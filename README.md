# Velox

### Meter every token. Sell commits. Know your margin.

**The open-source billing engine for AI and usage-heavy SaaS — runs in your own VPC.**

Velox owns the layer above PaymentIntent: pricing, subscriptions, multi-dimensional usage metering, invoicing, dunning, and credits. Stripe still does cards under the hood. The 0.5% Stripe Billing fee disappears, and customer billing data never leaves your infrastructure.

Built for three market truths Stripe Billing structurally cannot serve:

1. **AI/LLM apps need multi-dimensional pricing.** Real model pricing today is `model × token_type × tier × context-window`, where `token_type` is a disjoint role (`input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write_5m`, `cache_write_1h`). Stripe's Meter API forces one Meter per dimension combination — many Meters and ugly subscription wiring just to model a single model's token roles. Velox treats dimensions as first-class on the meter — and ingests straight from a LiteLLM proxy spend callback, no SDK.
2. **AI infra sells commit + usage.** "$10k prepaid commit, drawn down against metered usage" is the default AI-infra contract. Stripe Billing has no commit primitive; the engines that do (Orb, Metronome) are closed-source SaaS. In Velox a commit line on an invoice funds a credit block at finalize (atomic, fund-once); usage drains it — promotional credits first — with `credit.balance_low` / `depleted` / `recovered` webhooks to drive top-up nudges.
3. **Regulated tenants cannot put customer billing data on Stripe's servers.** EU GDPR-strict, India RBI data localization, healthcare-adjacent SaaS, government procurement. Stripe's whole model is "send us the data." Velox runs in your VPC.

## The wedge in code

Bill Anthropic-style multi-dimensional pricing (model × token_type) with **one meter**, sell a prepaid commit against it, and see per-customer margin — five calls, no Stripe Billing objects. (API from `make dev`, key from `make bootstrap` — see Quick start.)

```bash
# 1. Create one meter for "tokens"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/meters \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VELOX_SECRET" \
  -d '{"key": "tokens", "name": "LLM tokens", "unit": "token"}'

# 2. Ingest events that carry the dimensions inline
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/usage-events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VELOX_SECRET" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: req_8f2c..." \
  -d '{
    "event_name": "tokens",
    "external_customer_id": "cust_acme",
    "quantity": "12450",
    "dimensions": {"model": "gpt-4", "token_type": "input"}
  }'

# 3. Define one pricing rule per (dimension subset, rate)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/meters/$METER_ID/pricing-rules \
  -d '{
    "dimension_match": {"model": "gpt-4", "token_type": "input"},
    "rating_rule_version_id": "rrv_gpt4_input",
    "aggregation_mode": "sum",
    "priority": 100
  }'

# 4. Sell a $10k prepaid commit for $9k — the credit block funds when the
#    invoice finalizes, and usage draws it down
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/invoices/$INVOICE_ID/line-items \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VELOX_SECRET" \
  -d '{"description": "Annual commit", "line_type": "add_on",
       "quantity": 1, "unit_amount_cents": 900000,
       "commit_granted_cents": 1000000}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/invoices/$INVOICE_ID/finalize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VELOX_SECRET"

# 5. Know which customers lose you money — stamped provider COGS vs rated revenue
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/customers/$CUSTOMER_ID/margin \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VELOX_SECRET"
```

Already running a LiteLLM proxy? Skip step 2 — point its spend callback at `POST /v1/integrations/litellm/spend` and every completion lands as dimensioned token events (`model`, `token_type`), replay-deduped, no SDK. See [`docs/integrations/litellm.md`](docs/integrations/litellm.md).

What lands on the invoice (from `./scripts/demo.sh`, real output):

```text
ACME Corp — VLX-000001                                    $3.88
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tokens (claude-sonnet-4.5 · input)       400,000    →   $1.20
Tokens (claude-sonnet-4.5 · output)      175,000    →   $2.62
Tokens (claude-sonnet-4.5 · cache_read)  200,000    →   $0.06
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Margin (billed $3.88 vs provider cost $1.28)            67.1%
```

Token roles are disjoint, so each `{model, token_type}` is exactly one rule at equal priority — no double-count. A coarse catch-all (`{"model": "gpt-4"}`) and finer per-role rules (`{"model": "gpt-4", "token_type": "cache_read"}`) still compose cleanly via the priority+claim resolver. The full design — schema, aggregation semantics, decimal quantities, all five aggregation modes (`sum`, `count`, `last_during_period`, `last_ever`, `max`) — lives in [`docs/design-multi-dim-meters.md`](docs/design-multi-dim-meters.md).

## What's in the box

### AI/usage-native (the wedge)
- **Multi-dimensional meters** — one meter, N rules, dimensions on every event
- **LiteLLM drop-in** — point your proxy's spend callback at `POST /v1/integrations/litellm/spend`; calls become dimensioned token events (`model`, `token_type`) with idempotent replay dedupe — no SDK, no schema work
- **Prepaid commits + drawdown** — sell "pay $9k, get $10k" commits as invoice lines; the credit block funds atomically at finalize and usage draws it down, promotional credits first (ADR-078)
- **Per-customer margin (COGS) in-app** — maintain your provider rates once (`/v1/provider-costs`); every usage event is stamped with provider cost at ingest; `GET /v1/customers/{id}/margin` answers "which customers lose us money?" — per-model where pricing rules pin `model`, honest `unattributed_revenue` bucket otherwise (ADR-079)
- **Decimal quantities** — `NUMERIC(38, 12)` for fractional GPU-hours and partial tokens
- **Per-rule aggregation modes** — `sum`, `count`, `last_during_period`, `last_ever`, `max`
- **Pricing recipes** — one call instantiates products + prices + meters + dunning (`anthropic_style`, `openai_style`, `replicate_style`)
- **Customer cost visibility** — per-customer usage/cost breakdown in the dashboard, plus a token-authenticated public JSON endpoint (`/v1/public/cost-dashboard/{token}`, rotatable per-customer token) your app can render — "$4.31 of GPT-4 today" with a projected bill. A packaged embeddable widget is roadmap, not shipped.

### Self-host first
- **Docker Compose** — single-VM install, ~5 min from clone to invoice
- **Data sovereignty** — customer billing data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Append-only audit log** — DB-trigger enforced tamper-evidence
- **Row-Level Security** — one Velox deployment cleanly serves N internal tenants

### Stripe-grade primitives (already shipped)
- **Subscriptions** — trial state machine with atomic flips · pause-collection · scheduled cancellation · plan changes with proration
- **Pricing & discounts** — per-customer price overrides · credit ledger (prepaid allowances, drawn against usage). Coupons cut pre-launch (ADR-039) — AI-native peers converge on credits, not promo codes.
- **Invoicing & collection** — PDF invoices · hosted invoice page with secure tokens · branded multipart emails · dunning with breaker · invoice preview (`Invoice.upcoming` parity)
- **Spend controls** — hard-cap thresholds with mid-cycle finalize
- **Credits & refunds** — event-sourced credit ledger · credit notes + refunds
- **Reliability** — idempotency · transactional outbox · webhook signing with 72h rotation grace · test clocks

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the full ship log.

¹ Metronome was acquired by Stripe (Jan 2026) — still SaaS-only, so your billing data lives on Stripe's servers either way.
² OpenMeter (acquired by Kong, Sep 2025) is expanding from metering into billing — closing the engine gap, but not the self-host-with-Stripe-grade-depth one.

Velox lives in the empty cell: **OSS + self-host + AI-native + full billing engine.** Decision tree: pick **Stripe Billing** (or Stripe + Metronome) for hosted SaaS billing; pick **Lago** for generic OSS billing without an AI-shaped wedge; pick **Orb/Metronome** if you can't self-host and budget for usage-based contracts; pick **Velox** when you need AI-native billing that runs in your own VPC.

## What Velox is **not**

Stating these loudly so the wrong customers self-select out:

- **Not for vanilla card-first SaaS** with simple per-seat pricing — Stripe Billing is fine for them.
- **Not multi-PSP yet** — Stripe is the only payment processor. Razorpay/Adyen come when a paying tenant asks.
- **Not for marketplaces or Stripe Connect** — Velox bills the tenant's customers directly; it doesn't split payouts across sub-merchants. (Velox itself is multi-tenant via RLS — many billing tenants per deployment — but each tenant collects on its own behalf, not on behalf of others.)
- **No Revenue Recognition / Sigma** — bring your own warehouse + dbt.
- **No Quotes or Subscription Schedules** — sales-led contract billing should pick Recurly or Maxio.
- **No 50+ payment-method types** — cards via Stripe + send-invoice. ACH/SEPA expand from there.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagarsuperuser/velox.git && cd velox

# Backend — Postgres + bootstrap demo tenant + operator user + API keys
cp .env.example .env # make dev reads it; the defaults work for local dev as-is
docker compose up -d postgres
make bootstrap       # prints operator email + password + secret-test, secret-live, publishable-test keys
make dev             # API on :8080

# Operator dashboard (separate terminal)
cd web-v2 && npm install && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173 — sign in with the email + password from bootstrap
```

End-to-end demo — the whole wedge in ~30 seconds (Anthropic-style price matrix via one recipe call, LiteLLM-shaped token ingest, provider cost rates, a **test clock** that simulates a full billing month, a finalized invoice with per-`(model, token_type)` lines + PDF, and the per-customer margin report):

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh <vlx_secret_test_... from make bootstrap>
```

Every call in the script is checked — it fails loudly at the first API mismatch instead of pretending. Rerun it as often as you like (each run creates a fresh demo customer on its own test clock).

Self-host: single-VM Docker Compose. See [`docs/self-host.md`](docs/self-host.md). Helm/Terraform/multi-replica HA paths land when a design partner names which Kubernetes flavour they actually run — pre-emptively shipping three deployment shapes produced surface nobody was running.

## Architecture

```
cmd/velox/                  — single Go binary
internal/
  domain/                   — pure domain models, zero deps
  api/respond/              — Stripe-style JSON responses
  auth/                     — API key auth (3 key types, 17 permissions)
  tenant/                   — tenants + settings
  customer/                 — customer CRUD + billing profiles
  pricing/                  — meters, rating rules, plans, price overrides
  subscription/             — lifecycle (draft → trialing → active → paused → canceled)
  usage/                    — event ingestion + multi-dim aggregation
  invoice/                  — state machine (draft → finalized → paid) + PDF
  billing/                  — billing engine + scheduler + preview
  payment/                  — Stripe PaymentIntent + webhook receiver
  dunning/                  — payment retry state machine
  credit/                   — event-sourced prepaid balance ledger
  creditnote/               — credit notes + refunds
  webhook/                  — outbound webhooks (HMAC-signed delivery)
  audit/                    — immutable append-only audit log
  platform/postgres/        — RLS-aware database layer
  platform/migrate/         — embedded SQL migrations

web-v2/                     — operator dashboard (React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind)
```

Design rules:
- **Per-domain packages** — each domain owns its store, service, and handler. Zero cross-domain imports between peer packages.
- **Row-Level Security** — every tenant-scoped query runs inside an RLS-enforced transaction. Proven by integration tests.
- **PaymentIntent-only Stripe** — no Stripe Billing/Invoices. We own invoices end-to-end; Stripe executes the card charge.
- **Billing engine as coordinator** — orchestrates across domains via narrow interfaces, not a god object.
- **Append-only event sourcing for money** — credits, audit log, outbound webhook outbox.

ADRs explaining the load-bearing decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

API reference: [`api/openapi.yaml`](api/openapi.yaml) covers the core resource routes (usage, subscriptions, invoices, pricing, credits, provider costs, webhook endpoints); some operational routes (exports, analytics, audit log, settings) aren't in the spec yet. Webhook consumers: [`docs/webhooks.md`](docs/webhooks.md) — signature verification, envelope, retry ladder, event catalog, delivery contract.

## API key types

| Type        | Prefix            | What it can do                                           |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Platform    | `vlx_platform_`   | Tenant management only                                   |
| Secret      | `vlx_secret_`     | Full tenant access (server-side)                         |
| Publishable | `vlx_pub_`        | Usage ingestion + customer-bound reads (browser-safe)    |

API keys are salted-SHA-256 hashed at rest; rotation supports an optional grace window (immediate by default, up to 7 days) so in-flight requests keep authenticating while the old key winds down. (The 72-hour overlap window is Stripe's webhook-signing-secret pattern, which Velox mirrors for outbound webhook secrets — not API keys.)

## Roadmap

### Recently shipped

- **Team invites (Jul 2026, ADR-081)** — invite teammates by email (tokenized single-use accept links, member removal with session revocation); kills the shared-password reality and gives the audit log real per-person actors. No RBAC yet — every member has full access, roles recorded for the future split
- **Provider cost tables + margin (Jul 2026, ADR-079)** — enter what you pay LLM providers; every usage event is stamped with its COGS at ingest; per-customer margin report (billed vs cost by model) — the report every other billing engine makes you build in your warehouse
- **Prepaid commits + drawdown (Jul 2026, ADR-078)** — sell commit + usage: a commit line on an invoice funds a credit block at finalize (fund-once, atomic), promotional credits drain before paid, balance-threshold webhooks (`credit.balance_low/depleted/recovered`), void retires the unfunded remainder
- **Full-product audit hardening (Jul 2026)** — a 117-finding end-to-end audit remediated in 13 gated PRs: threshold billing exactness, checkout/trial state-machine races, credit expiry atomicity, price-change semantics (pinned per-period resolution), transport delivery leases (no more duplicate emails/webhooks under load), self-host truth (one bootstrap, real `APP_DATABASE_URL`, race-safe migrations), and honest MRR analytics
- **Operator search that actually searches** — server-side `?search=` on customers (matches encrypted name/email post-decryption), invoices, and subscriptions; invoice date-range + past-due filters; ⌘K palette queries the full dataset
- **Multi-dimensional meters** — one meter, N pricing rules, decimal quantities (`NUMERIC(38, 12)`), all five aggregation modes
- **Decimal per-unit rates** — sub-cent-per-unit pricing (e.g. $3.00 / 1M tokens) bills linearly and exactly via decimal unit prices (Stripe `unit_amount_decimal` model); invoice totals stay whole cents
- **Pricing recipes** — `anthropic_style`, `openai_style`, `replicate_style`; recipe-picker UI; one-click uninstall
- **`create_preview`, billing thresholds** — Stripe Tier-1 surfaces with multi-dim parity
- **Customer cost visibility** — dashboard cost view plus token-authenticated public cost JSON (rotatable per-customer token)
- **Stripe-grade billing primitives** — subscriptions (trial/pause/cancel/plan-change with proration), credit notes, dunning, hosted invoice page, transactional outbox

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the full ship log.

### In flight

- **Seeking our first design partner** — AI-infra at $1M–$50M ARR (see Contributing)
- **AI-native primitive sharpening** — per-token, model-tier, prompt/completion split surfacing in dashboard + invoices

### Explicitly deferred (on hold pending design partner)

- Helm chart + Terraform AWS module + multi-replica HA
- Stripe Billing migration tool (`velox-import`)
- SOC 2 / GDPR-deletion / audit-log retention / encryption-at-rest enterprise-readiness docs
- RBAC / role enforcement (invites shipped Jul 2026 per ADR-081 with every member holding full access; role-scoped permissions land when a DP names the split. SSO direction predetermined per ADR-014 — embedded OIDC/SAML libs in-process when a DP asks, never a SaaS auth vendor)
- Operator polish: bulk actions, billing-alerts UI, plan-migration cohort UI, live event stream, embedded dashboard docs site

These are paused — not killed. They land when a real customer names the specific shape they need; pre-launch, pre-evidence builds optimise the wrong version of each.

---

## Tech stack

**Backend** — Go 1.25, chi/v5 router, PostgreSQL 16 with RLS, `shopspring/decimal` for money, `go-pdf/fpdf` for invoices, Prometheus metrics.

**Frontend** — React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide icons.

**Payments** — Stripe (PaymentIntents + Checkout Sessions). No Stripe Billing dependency.

---

## Running tests

```bash
make test                # unit tests only
make test-integration    # full integration suite (needs Postgres)
```

Integration tests exercise real Postgres with RLS enforced. Per project convention, tests must hit a real database — never mocks — so a passing test means migrations and RLS work end-to-end.

## Contributing

Velox is open source under MIT. We're early and looking for design partners: 12 months of white-glove support for your self-hosted deployment — we pair on install, upgrades, and pricing-model setup — in exchange for weekly check-ins and a co-branded case study. If you run AI inference, a vector DB, or any usage-heavy SaaS at $1M–$50M ARR and Stripe Billing is starting to chafe — open an issue or email `partners@velox.dev`.

For code contributions, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Major features land with a design RFC alongside the code — read any `docs/design-*.md` for the pattern.
