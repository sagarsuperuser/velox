// TestClockStatus tracks what a test clock is doing. Mirrors Stripe's API.

//   - ready: idle, safe to advance or delete.
//   - advancing: a catchup run is in flight; further advances are rejected
//     until it completes.
//   - internal_failure: the last advance errored partway through; the clock
//     is frozen at an intermediate state and the tenant must inspect
//     (advances and subscription attachment stay blocked).
