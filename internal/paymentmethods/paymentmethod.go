// Package paymentmethods is the customer-facing view of payment methods.
//
// payment_methods rows are the canonical many-to-one store (multiple cards
// per customer, one flagged default). The existing customer_payment_setups
// table stays as the 1:1 denorm summary that billing reads for the "one
// default card" path — this package writes both on every mutation.
//
// The operator routes run under API-key auth: tenantID comes from the auth
// ctx and customerID from the URL path; both are pushed into BeginTx.
