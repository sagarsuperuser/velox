// Package session implements dashboard sessions minted by the
// email+password login flow. The credential is the operator's
// password (verified via bcrypt); the browser-side artefact is an
// httpOnly cookie tied to the user — see ADR-011 for the full
// rationale and what changed from the previous (key-bound) shape.
//
// The package deliberately exposes only the surface the dashboard auth
// flow needs: Issue (mint a session for an authenticated user), Get
// (resolve a cookie value to its session row), Revoke (logout).
// Everything is keyed by sha256(raw_id); the raw id only ever lives
// in the cookie.
