// WHY THIS GATE EXISTS
//
// audit_log is APPEND-ONLY, and migration 0150 revoked DELETE and TRUNCATE from
// the runtime role. Whatever a writer puts into a row is there forever: it cannot
// be corrected, redacted, or erased by the application, ever. That makes the audit
// log the one table in Velox from which a person's email address can never be
// removed — a GDPR-erasure dead end.
//
// The rule is therefore: an audit row POINTS AT a person (resource_id = their user
// id, or the id of an erasable row like a member_invitations record). It never
// STORES their address. The reader resolves the address at query time by joining
// the mutable, erasable table (internal/audit/audit.go, auditListSelect), so
// deleting the person deletes the address from every historical row at once.
//
// There WAS a guard for this. It caught nothing, because it checked only:
//   - metadata (not resource_label, which is where the addresses actually were),
//   - values that assert to string (so a struct or a []string sailed through), and
//   - the two customer writers (so auth, members and bootstrap were never looked at).
//
// Under it, SEVEN writers were putting live email addresses into the append-only
// log: login, password_reset_requested, password_reset_completed, member.invited
// (label AND metadata), member.joined, and bootstrap's owner_email. A guard whose
// scope is narrower than the rule it guards is not a guard.
//
// This one is source-level and repo-wide on purpose: it cannot be satisfied by a
// writer the author forgot to add to a list.

// auditEmitCall matches a call that writes an audit row, in any of its shapes.

// Deliberately syntactic — it reads what the writer HANDS OVER, which is the thing
// that becomes permanent.
