// WHY THESE GATES EXIST
//
// The audit redesign (ADR-089/090) was audited for completeness THREE times. Each
// round found ~30 places where a comment, an ADR paragraph, a registry note or a
// runbook box claimed something the code does not do — and each round's FIXES
// left siblings behind, or introduced fresh lies of their own. The third round
// caught a comment asserting a route is `explicit` when the registry says
// `exempt`, in a commit whose entire purpose was to remove false claims.
//
// The lesson is not "try harder". It is:
//
//	PROSE THAT MAKES A PRECISE, CHECKABLE CLAIM AND IS NEVER CHECKED WILL DRIFT.
//	Either mechanize the check, or do not make the claim.
//
// These are the mechanized checks for the two classes that drifted in every
// single round. They are deliberately cheap and deliberately literal.

// sourceFiles walks internal/ and hands back every non-test .go file.

// markSkipCallers is the CANONICAL list of paths that declare "this 2xx mutated
// nothing" (audit.MarkSkip). It is duplicated in prose in two places that keep
// going stale — internal/audit/context.go's "Live callers" list and ADR-090 §4 —
// so it is pinned HERE, against the code, and those two now point at this test
// rather than trying to enumerate from memory.
//
// Adding a MarkSkip call is a real decision: it tells the coverage detector that a
// successful mutating request legitimately wrote no audit row. If you add one,
// add it here and say why. If this list is longer than you expected, that is the
// point — a silent MarkSkip is a route quietly opting out of audit coverage.
// markSkipCaller is a declared opt-out of audit coverage: n calls in one file,
// and the reason they are legitimate.
//
// The COUNT is load-bearing. The first version of this gate keyed on the FILE
// alone — so adding a tenth MarkSkip to a file that already declared nine passed
// CI silently, while this very comment claimed "add a MarkSkip call without
// declaring it and CI fails". A gate that under-enforces its own stated contract
// is the failure class this whole arc is about, reproduced inside the fix for it.
// Pinning n means a NEW opt-out in an existing file breaks the build.
