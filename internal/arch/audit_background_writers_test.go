// The residual own-tx audit writers, and why each one is still allowed.
//
// ADR-090 made audit emission ride the BUSINESS transaction (`LogInTx`): the row
// and the change it describes commit together or not at all. The money-path
// handler routes named LogInTx in the route registry are migrated; most other
// mutating routes and the engine are NOT — those call sites still use the own-tx `Log`, which
// writes the row in a SEPARATE transaction AFTER the business change has already
// committed. If that write fails, the mutation stands and its evidence does not.
// That is the `row_lost` outcome on velox_audit_write_errors_total, and nothing
// retries it.
//
// Every one of these discards the error (`_ =`), which is correct and is also the
// point: post-commit, there is nothing the caller can do. The only real fix is to
// stop writing post-commit, and that means threading the business tx down to the
// emission — a money-path change per domain, under the playbook gates, which is
// what ADR-090 says each domain does in its own PR.
//
// So this gate does the one thing that is both cheap and load-bearing today: it
// makes the residual set EXPLICIT and SHRINKING. Adding a new own-tx background
// writer fails CI. Migrating one to LogInTx fails CI until it is deleted from this
// map. The map is the migration backlog, and it can only go down.
//
// Keyed by action, counted — not by file:line, which rots on the first edit above
// the call, and not by file alone, which would let a new call hide inside a file
// that is already listed. (That exact miss shipped once in this arc's own MarkSkip
// gate, which was file-keyed and therefore blind to new calls in declared files.)
// MIGRATED (no longer here): "finalize". As of 2026-07-15 every engine finalize
// path emits its audit row IN the invoice-create transaction
// (CreateInvoiceWithLineItemsAudited on the own-tx paths; LogInTx on the
// coordinator tx for the cross-interval swap, the atomic cancel, and the threshold
// reset) — shared fate, ADR-090. It was the highest-value row and the first domain
// migrated off the post-commit Log; the six textual finalize sites (cycle close,
// subscription create, both cancel paths, both swap paths, threshold) are covered
// by the shared-fate + sim-axis-parity tests. This is the shrinking set doing its
// job: one entry removed, proven, gone.

// scan silently skipped it for weeks, which is why a missing directory is now
// a test failure, not a continue.) "paymentmethods" is deliberately NOT here:
