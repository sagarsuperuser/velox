// TestStreamForExport_IsASnapshot is the regression lock for issue #475 — the
// bug that let the ONE artifact an operator hands to an auditor lie.
//
// The exports used to page each store with LIMIT/OFFSET, every page in its own
// transaction, over a newest-first ordering. A row inserted while the export ran
// entered at the HEAD of that ordering and shifted every later row down by one —
// so the row sitting on each page boundary was written to the CSV TWICE, and a
// delete symmetrically SKIPPED one. No error, no warning; just a file with a
// duplicated customer in it.
//
// The fix is a single snapshot transaction, and this test writes rows CONCURRENTLY
// while the stream is running — from a separate connection that commits — which
// is precisely the interleaving the old code could not survive. Three properties,
// each of which the old paging violated:
//
//  1. no row appears twice        (the page-boundary duplicate)
//  2. every pre-existing row appears  (the delete/shift skip)
//  3. rows created AFTER the snapshot opened do NOT appear — the artifact is the
//     data at ONE moment, not a smear across the minutes the export took
//
// Seeded well past a page boundary: at the old exportPageSize of 100, 250 rows
// meant three pages and two boundaries to corrupt.
