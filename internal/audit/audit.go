// SIM-AXIS COVERAGE (ADR-090 §5) — what ?test_clock_id= can and cannot see.
//
// COVERED: every path that runs under a clock binding. That is every ForClock /
// catchup phase (the advance binds clock.WithSim, so finalize, cancel, clawback
// issue, dunning and threshold rows all inherit it), every service whose entry
// point resolves an entity's pin (BindEffectiveNow yields the clock id along
// with the instant, and refuses to erase an inherited one), and the
// handler-level emitters that bind explicitly before emitting (invoice,
// subscription, customer — including CREATE, which binds from the clock it is
// handed because the customer pin does not exist yet — dunning, test_clock).
//
// A note on what "covered" means, so this list cannot quietly become a lie: a
// path is covered if it EMITS and its emission runs under a binding. Credit
// expiry runs under the catchup binding but emits NO audit row at all — the
// credit ledger is event-sourced and immutable, so the expiry entry IS the
// record, exactly as usage_events is the record for metering. It was listed
// here as covered, which credited a row that does not exist. Closure trigger:
// if credit expiry ever emits, it needs nothing but the ctx it already has.
//
// NOT COVERED — stated because a filter that omits rows silently is worse than
// no filter at all:
//
//   - Operator-driven CREDIT-NOTE routes (create/issue/void/retry-refund/send).
//     creditnote.Service has no clock.Resolver at all: the same defect that
//     makes an operator-issued CN against a simulated invoice stamp wall-clock
//     issued_at and is_simulated=false. Stamping the audit row while the entity
//     stays wall-clock would hide that bug inside the audit layer. Closure: fix
//     the CN clock binding — the sim axis then follows from ctx with no change
//     here. (Clock-DRIVEN CN paths — the catchup clawback issuer — ARE stamped.)
//   - Operator-driven PRICE-OVERRIDE routes (create/delete a customer price
//     override). Same root cause as the CN routes: internal/pricing has no
//     clock.Resolver at all, so the handler emits on an unbound r.Context() and
//     the row lands with NULL sim columns. This one is NOT a "not in the clock
//     domain" case and must not be mistaken for one — customer_price_overrides
//     IS torn down with the clock (ADR-086, testclock/postgres.go), so an
//     operator who negotiates a price for a simulated customer mid-simulation
//     leaves a row that is invisible to ?test_clock_id= AND, after teardown, is
//     the only surviving evidence the override ever existed. Closure: give
//     pricing a clock.Resolver and bind at the handler — the axis then follows
//     from ctx with no change here.
//   - PAYMENT-METHOD routes. Stripe PM state is a real-world effect with no
//     simulated counterpart; paymentmethods is not in the clock domain. A
//     clock-scoped view will not show "operator attached a card mid-simulation."
//   - PUBLIC CHECKOUT rows (hosted-invoice Pay click, payment-update link,
//     checkout setup). These paths never bind a pin — they stamp wall-clock and
//     talk to real Stripe — so their rows are wall-clock rows about an entity
//     that happens to be pinned. This is consistent with what the clock view
//     already cannot show: the SETTLEMENT those clicks lead to is a Stripe
//     webhook, which the registry already records as writing no audit row at
//     all. Closure trigger: the same one — auditing the settle path.
//
// A row from either class has NULL sim columns and is therefore absent from the
// simulated slice — not mis-attributed. That is the safe failure direction, and
// it is the reason this comment exists instead of a plausible-looking guess.
//
// simColumns resolves the sim axis for an emission from the ctx's clock
// binding: the clock whose world this code path is running in, and the
// simulated instant it lands at. Returns (nil, nil) — SQL NULLs — for every
// wall-clock path, which is the overwhelming majority of rows and the reason
// the clock index (0148) is partial.
//
// It also mirrors the pair into the metadata bag under the legacy keys the
// dashboard already renders, so the audit page's sim subline keeps working on
// old and new rows alike. The mirror is a COPY — the caller's map is never
// mutated, because emitters build their metadata once and reuse it.
//
// THE WRITER OWNS metadata["sim_effective_at"] AND metadata["test_clock_id"].
// Emitters must not set them: this function overwrites both unconditionally,
// silently, and an emitter cannot tell its value was dropped. Seven emitters
// used to hand-stamp them. Four wrote the same instant this does and were pure
// duplication. The other three (the trial-end cancel/activate rows) wrote the
// TRIAL-END instant — a genuinely different fact — and had it destroyed under
// catchup, because a catchup performs the cancel at the ADVANCE's instant,
// which can be weeks of simulated time after the trial ended. All seven are
// gone; the trial-end instant now travels as metadata["trial_end_at"], which
// says what it is. If you need another simulated instant on a row, give it its
// own key — do not overload this one.
//
// Both halves come from one clock.Sim, resolved from one read of the clock
// (clock.Resolver / the ForClock drivers), so the column pair can never
// disagree with itself. A partial binding reports Simulated()=false and is
// treated as absent rather than half-stamped: a row with a clock id and a
// wall-clock instant would sit IN the partial index and answer sim-time
// queries with a lie.

// LogInTx is TOTAL by construction (design-panel amendment A2): tenant_id is

// {"marshal_error": …} payload instead of aborting a money transaction on a
// telemetry bug; a partial clock binding is treated as absent rather than
// polluting the partial clock index with a half-truth; the sim axis is
// derived from ctx, never supplied by the caller (simColumns);
// livemode is stamped by the table trigger from the same tx session. The

//
//   - Rolled back after we return? Then the mutation failed and the handler
//     answers non-2xx, and the detector only inspects 2xx — so a rolled-back
//     emission can never make an uncovered mutation look covered.
//   - A secondary emission deep inside another route's flow (the
//     proration-fallback grant inside a change-plan request) marks that request
//     too. That costs nothing REAL — the detector is a runtime backstop, and the
//     thing that actually holds a route to its own emission is the route-audit
//     registry + its arch test (internal/api/audit_routes.go), which forces every
//     mutating route to declare explicit or exempt(reason) in review. The blind
//     spot is bounded and named: a route that emits nothing of its own but nests
//     someone else's emission reads as covered at runtime.

// Self-marking is also load-bearing: POST /v1/tenants and both public checkout
