// requestState answers ONE request-scoped question: "is this request's audit
// story accounted for?" Exactly two things set it:
//
//   - a successful emission — Logger.Log and Logger.LogInTx self-mark, so any
//     real audit row for this request counts, wherever in the call stack it was
//     written (handler, service, or an in-tx emission deep inside a store).
//   - MarkSkip: the code that owns the decision declaring this request mutated
//     nothing, so there is nothing to audit — a read-only POST (invoice/recipe
//     *preview*), or a no-op branch of a mutating route (a logout with a stale
//     cookie, a password-reset for an unknown email, a settings save that
//     changed no field, an idempotency replay, a recipe re-apply that installs
//     nothing). Without this declaration those paths are indistinguishable, to
//     an observer at the transport, from a mutation that FORGOT its audit row —
//     and a detector that cries wolf on a normal client retry is a detector
//     nobody keeps.
//
// One reader consumes it: the AuditCoverage detector (a pure observer — a
// mutating 2xx that is not accounted for is an UNCOVERED MUTATION, the thing
// the deleted catch-all used to paper over with a guessed row).
//
// There is deliberately no exported "I wrote a row" mark. The old MarkHandled
// let a handler ASSERT coverage; the only thing that may assert coverage now is
// an audit row that actually landed.
//
// Kept as a pointer so a mark made anywhere downstream is visible back in the
// middleware frame through the ctx value lookup.

// while the detector read the outer, so every covered route would look
// uncovered. One request, one cell.

// internal/arch/audit_prose_gates_test.go (markSkipCallers): add a MarkSkip call
