// query results (RLS returns the same rows) — it only silently destroys the
// query plan, turning every audit read back into a full multi-tenant seq
// scan. Result-based tests are therefore structurally blind to a revert;
// this test is not. Its integration twin (the EXPLAIN pin in
// read_path_integration_test.go) proves the predicate shape actually drives
// idx_audit_log_tenant_read.
