// Prometheus client counters never age out: a label value that appears once is
// exported by that process forever. So a single shared-database blip during a busy
// hour mints a permanent time series per affected tenant — cardinality that grows
// with the customer base, is never reclaimed, and outlives the incident it
// described. It is also the wrong instrument for the question: an alert wants to
// know THAT evidence is at risk; a log wants to know WHICH tenant, and logs expire.
//
// The label is now `outcome`, whose domain is closed and has exactly two members.
