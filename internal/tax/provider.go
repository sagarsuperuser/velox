// Package tax defines the tenant-selectable tax calculation backend and

// (flat tenant-level rate), and StripeTaxProvider (Stripe Tax API with a
// manual fallback on errors).

// billing engine calls Calculate at invoice build time and, for
// providers that support it, Commit at invoice finalize time to durably
// record the tax decision with the upstream (e.g. create a Stripe
