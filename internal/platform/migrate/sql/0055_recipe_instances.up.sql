-- Pricing recipes: thin index of which recipes have been instantiated for
-- which tenant.
--
-- The canonical entities a recipe creates (products, meters, rating rules,
-- pricing rules, plans, dunning policies, webhook endpoints) live in their
-- own per-domain tables and obey their own constraints. This table only
-- tracks instantiation metadata so we can:
--
--   1. Idempotency-check by (tenant_id, recipe_key) on POST /v1/recipes/instantiate.
--   2. Surface "anthropic_style instantiated 3 days ago" on the dashboard.
--   3. Drive force-re-instantiate cleanup via the created_object_ids map.
--
-- A tenant deleting a meter that came from a recipe does NOT cascade to
-- recipe_instances; recipes are an instantiation event, not an ownership
-- relationship. Operators reconcile by re-instantiating with force=true
-- (platform key only) or by manually editing the entities they own.
--
-- See docs/design-recipes.md for the full design and override semantics.
