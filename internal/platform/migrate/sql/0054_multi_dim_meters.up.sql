-- Multi-dimensional meters: foundation for AI-native pricing.
--
-- Three coordinated changes per docs/design-multi-dim-meters.md:
--
--   1. usage_events.quantity becomes NUMERIC(38, 12).
--      AI usage is intrinsically fractional (GPU-hours, cached-token
--      ratios, partial KV-cache reads) and BIGINT can only express it via
--      lossy unit-scaling at the application layer. NUMERIC(38, 12) gives
--      the operator a quantity primitive that holds both whole counts and
--      fractions without a per-tenant scale convention. Maps to Stripe's
--      quantity_decimal (Tier 1 parity gap).
--
--   2. New meter_pricing_rules table. N rules per meter, each carrying
--      a dimension_match JSONB filter, an aggregation_mode, and a priority.
--      Each event is claimed by the highest-priority matching rule (no
--      double-count). Default rule has dimension_match='{}' which matches
--      everything; priority=0 keeps it last so specific rules win first.
--
-- The GIN index on usage_events.properties used to live here as
-- `CREATE INDEX … USING GIN (properties)`. It has been hoisted to its own
-- migration (0062) using `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid the 53.5s
-- AccessExclusiveLock on `usage_events` measured by the populated-DB
-- safety harness — see docs/migration-safety-findings.md ("Already fixed"
-- section). The retrofit is safe for already-deployed instances because
-- 0062 uses `IF NOT EXISTS`.
--
-- Backward compatibility:
--   - meters.aggregation column is left in place but becomes advisory; the
--     authoritative aggregation mode is now per-rule on meter_pricing_rules.
--     A separate cleanup migration may deprecate it once all consumers move.
--   - quantity column rename: BIGINT -> NUMERIC is a metadata-only change
--     when no rows exist (pre-launch), and a rewrite when rows exist. We
--     are pre-launch / local-only, so this is effectively free. The
--     production-safe rework into ADD COLUMN + backfill + rename is
--     DEFERRED until after Phase 3 cutover (needs backfill machinery; see
--     docs/migration-safety-findings.md "0054 — column rewrite — DEFERRED").
