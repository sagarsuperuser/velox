// Package scheduler hosts the standard tick-loop runner used by every
// background worker in Velox: billing scheduler, email outbox, webhook
// outbox, webhook retry, billing-alert evaluator, etc.
//
// Before this helper, every worker hand-rolled the same select-on-
// ticker loop. Five copies started drifting (some logged a heartbeat,
// some didn't; none had panic recovery, so a panic mid-tick would
// silently kill the goroutine and the ticker would buffer forever).
// This package consolidates the shape so each worker is ~3 lines and
// shares one place to wire panic recovery, heartbeat logging, and
// future hooks (status registry, prometheus counters).

// heartbeatThreshold marks the boundary between "slow" workers (that
// log a heartbeat at INFO every tick) and "fast" workers (where INFO
// per tick would be log-volume noise — they emit at DEBUG instead).
//
// 1 minute keeps billing / billing-alerts / webhook-retry visible in
// `tail -f` for an operator running locally; sub-minute workers
// (email outbox 5s, webhook outbox 2s) stay quiet and rely on the
// per-dispatch logs they already emit when work happens.

// WorkFunc is the per-tick body. It must be safe to call repeatedly
// and return cleanly on ctx cancellation. Errors are the WorkFunc's
// to log — the runner does not attempt to interpret return values
// because each worker has its own outcome shape (count + []error,
// just error, just nothing).
type WorkFunc func(ctx context.Context)

// Run drives a standard tick loop until ctx is cancelled. Every tick:
//
//  1. Logs a heartbeat at INFO (interval >= 1 minute) or DEBUG
//     (sub-minute), so a `tail -f` shows visible pulse for slow
//     workers without flooding for fast ones.
//
//  2. Calls workFn inside a panic-recovering wrapper. A panic during
//     a single tick logs at ERROR with the recovered value plus a
//     full stack and continues to the next tick — without this, a
//     panic would kill the goroutine silently while the ticker
//     channel kept buffering.
//
// On ctx.Done the runner logs "stopped" and returns. Boot/teardown
// log lines are emitted by the caller before/after Run so each
// worker can choose its phrasing ("dispatcher started", "evaluator
// started", etc.) and include any worker-specific metadata
// (batch size, target queue) the runner doesn't know about.
