// Why ctx-aware, not bare Now(): on a clock-pinned billing entity,
// every business-logic timestamp must be in the test clock's
// frozen_time domain (Stripe's "no semantic change" guarantee). A
// bare wall-clock Now() forces every callsite to remember to resolve
// the pin manually — exactly the leak we hit shipping ADR-029. With
// a ctx-aware Now(ctx), services bind effective-now once at the
// operator entry point and every downstream callsite (including
// stores) inherits automatically.
//
// Callers that legitimately want wall-clock regardless of pinning
// (cron tick scheduler, webhook delivery timestamps, postgres
// updated_at columns, audit-log recorded_at) call time.Now().UTC()
// directly — we don't go through Clock for those, by design.
