	//      good (the dispatcher's retry + DLQ only own delivery AFTER the
	//      enqueue lands). They run FIRST, before any network call. This
	//      block was historically last, below two Stripe calls, while its
	//      comment claimed a "sub-ms" crash window — the window was
	//      seconds-wide and grew every time a PR inserted another call
	//      above it (2026-07-05 reassessment).
	//   2. dunning resolve: idempotent AND backstopped — the dunning
	//      sweep's paid-pre-check floor re-resolves it on the next tick.
	//   3. checkout-session expire + card stamp: Stripe NETWORK calls with
	//      their own backstops (session ExpiresAt <= 1h; card stamp is a
	//      cosmetic timeline sub-line).
	//
	// RULE for future additions: this block is APPEND-ONLY AT THE END —
	// inserting a call above the receipt enqueue widens the unrecoverable
	// window again. A new step may only go earlier if it is a fast DB write
	// whose loss is MORE expensive than a receipt.
	//
	// Receipt email is deliberately NOT in-tx: strict atomicity is the wrong
	// contract for email, and folding it in would drag customer-email
	// resolution + the suppression-list read under the invoice row lock.
