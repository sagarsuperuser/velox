// stripeDeclineHumanMessage maps Stripe's machine-readable decline_code
// values to operator-facing English. Sourced from Stripe's official
// documentation: https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes
//
// Why a curated map rather than mechanical title-case humanization:
//   - Some codes don't read as English when title-cased ("Do not honor.",
//     "Lost card.", "Pickup card." — terse and ambiguous).
//   - Stripe's docs already provide operator-safe phrasings; using them
//     keeps Velox's UI consistent with how Stripe's own dashboard
//     renders the same codes.
//   - Operator copy is uniform regardless of which code surfaces (no
//     mix of "Insufficient funds" and "Pickup card.").
//
// Codes not in this map fall back to title-case humanization via
// humanizeDeclineCode — covers new codes Stripe adds without
// requiring a code update.
