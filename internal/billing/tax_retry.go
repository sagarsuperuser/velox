// Tax-retry policy for the background reconciler (ADR-017).
//
// Industry references walked before settling on these values:
//
//   Stripe:    payment retries cap at 8 attempts over ~3 weeks
//              (Smart Retries). Tax internally retried by their
//              backend; surface contract is "draft until resolved".
//   Recurly:   tax cron retries on transient errors with 5min →
//              30min → 1h → 6h → 24h backoff, max ~10 attempts.
//   Chargebee: retries provider_outage / timeout codes only.
//   Lago:      no automatic retry; manual operator action only.
//
// Velox lands on Recurly's curve (which is itself the Stripe-Smart-
// Retries shape adapted to tax). 8 attempts cover transient outages
// over ~10 days; longer than that and an operator should know.

// maxTaxRetryAttempts is the hard cap on automatic retries before
// the reconciler stops re-scheduling. After the cap, the invoice
// stays at tax_status=pending|failed with its last tax_error_code
// — the attention banner ESCALATES to Critical on exhaustion (the
// classifier reads the same policy), and the worker stops burning
// provider quota. Sourced from domain so the banner's asserted
// policy and the reconciler's SQL predicate cannot drift apart.
const maxTaxRetryAttempts = domain.MaxTaxRetryAttempts

// taxRetryBackoff returns the wait duration for the Nth attempt.
// `attempts` is the number of attempts already made (so 0 → first
// retry, 1 → second, etc.).
//
// Schedule:
//
//	1st retry → +5  min
//	2nd       → +15 min
//	3rd       → +1  hour
//	4th       → +4  hours
//	5th       → +12 hours
//	6th       → +1  day
//	7th       → +2  days
//	8th       → +4  days
//
// ±10% jitter is added to each interval so a Stripe Tax outage
// recovering at T+5min doesn't produce a thundering herd of every
// stuck invoice retrying within the same second.

// truth-audit finding). provider_not_configured joined the list then:
// it fails PRE-FLIGHT (no provider call, no quota burn) and retrying
// self-heals an invoice that raced a Stripe connect. Remaining
// non-retryable codes (auth, bad customer data, unregistered
// jurisdiction) stay operator-action-required — retrying those burns
// provider quota with no chance of success.
