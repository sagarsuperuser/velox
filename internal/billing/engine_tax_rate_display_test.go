// TestDisplayTaxRate pins the rule that the invoice-level invoices.tax_rate is
// the STATUTORY rate when every taxed line shares one rate (the common
// single-jurisdiction case), and only falls back to the blended effective rate
// for genuinely multi-rate invoices. This is what fixes the NYC case: Stripe's
// effective rate is 8.88 (888÷10000) but the line items carry the true 8.8750,
// which is the rate the customer/auditor should see. See ADR-047.
