// TestCreatePreview_OptsOutOfAudit pins the fix for the spurious "Created
// invoice" audit rows: POST /v1/invoices/create_preview is a read-only dry-run,
// so its handler declares audit.MarkSkip. Under the deleted catch-all the preview
// (fired automatically by the dashboard's upcoming-invoice card) recorded a bogus
// row whose "View" link → /invoices/create_preview → GET → 405 Method Not Allowed;
// today the declaration is what stops the coverage detector reporting a POST that
// writes nothing as an uncovered mutation.
//
// The request uses a blank customer_id so it errors before any store calls;
// MarkSkip is called first regardless, which is what we assert.
