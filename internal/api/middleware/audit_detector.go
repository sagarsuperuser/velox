// NO audit evidence and are not declared exempt. Labeled by ROUTE PATTERN — never
// the raw path, which carries ids (and, on the public surfaces, live payment
// tokens) and would blow up cardinality.
//
// A non-zero value means a state change committed with no compliance record: the
// route is missing its audit emission, or a new route shipped without one. Alert
// on any sustained rate. (The route-audit registry's arch test is the BUILD-time
// gate; this is the runtime backstop for the case the static gate cannot see —
// a declared-explicit route whose emission silently stopped firing.)

// AuditCoverage returns a middleware that DETECTS uncovered mutations. It is a
// PURE OBSERVER.
//
// It replaces the AuditLog catch-all, which "guaranteed" coverage by writing a
// row for any mutating /v1 request no handler had claimed — inferring the action
// and resource from the URL and sniffing the response body for a label. That
// invented false permanent records in an append-only compliance log (a pricing
// rule deleted from a meter was recorded as "deleted meter X"), and it covered
// only the /v1 block, so /v1/auth, /v1/tenants, /v1/public/*, /v1/webhooks and
// /v1/bootstrap got nothing at all (ADR-090, RC1 + RC2). Coverage is now
// DECLARED (the route-audit registry) and EMITTED in the business transaction
// (audit.Logger.LogInTx). This middleware only reports when reality diverges.
//
// Two invariants, both load-bearing:
//
//  1. It NEVER MUTATES THE RESPONSE. No status swap, no body rewrite, no error
//     injection. The catch-all's response-swapping ancestor (the per-tenant
//     fail-closed 503) is what caused the idempotency-poisoning bug in ADR-089:
//     the business tx had ALREADY committed, so the 503 was a lie — and the
//     Idempotency layer cached that lie for 24h, stranding the real response and
//     inviting a fresh-key double-mutation. Telemetry does not get to overwrite a
//     committed money mutation's answer. Ever.
//
//  2. It NEVER BUFFERS THE BODY. chi's WrapResponseWriter captures the status
//     with a pass-through Write (only Tee() buffers — we never call it) and
//     preserves http.Flusher / http.Hijacker / io.ReaderFrom through typed
//     wrappers. The catch-all buffered every response to sniff a label out of it,
//     and its buffer implemented none of those interfaces — which is why the CSV
//     exports, on a route given a 5-minute timeout precisely BECAUSE it streams,
//     silently accumulated in memory instead of streaming.
//
// isExempt resolves (method, canonical route pattern) against the registry; it is
// injected because the registry lives in package api (which imports this package).
