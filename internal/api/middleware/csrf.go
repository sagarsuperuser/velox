// CSRFGuard is the server-side CSRF defense for the cookie-authenticated
// dashboard surface. It rejects a state-changing request that a *browser*
// initiated from a site other than the trusted dashboard, before the request
// can spend the operator's ambient session cookie.
//
// # Why this exists (and why CORS did not already cover it)
//
// CSRF is an ambient-authority problem: the browser attaches velox_session to
// every request to the API automatically, so any page the operator visits can
// cause a request that carries it. SameSite=Lax narrows this (it withholds the
// cookie from most cross-site requests) but is not sufficient on its own — it
// still permits top-level GET navigation, and it does nothing about a cookie
// being *set* cross-site, which is how the login-fixation variant worked (an
// attacker's cross-site POST to /v1/auth/login minted and set THEIR session in
// the victim's browser). The existing CORS middleware is not a defense here at
// all: it governs whether the attacker's JS may *read the response*, never
// whether the request *executes* — a form POST or any "simple request" runs the
// handler regardless of CORS, and a login-fixation attacker never needs to read
// anything, the Set-Cookie side effect already happened.
//
// # The rule
//
// For unsafe methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE), unless the request carries an
// Authorization: Bearer header, the request must be same-site:
//
//   - A Bearer request is EXEMPT **only when it carries no session cookie**. A
//     bearer key is a non-ambient credential — an attacker cannot make a
//     victim's browser attach it — so the SDK/server-to-server path (bearer, no
//     cookie) is CSRF-immune and legitimately sends no Origin. But a request
//     bearing BOTH a bearer header AND a session cookie is not a legitimate
//     shape (the SDK has no cookie; the dashboard sends no bearer): it is the
//     "add a junk Authorization header to trip the exemption, let the ambient
//     cookie authenticate" move, which a permissive (CORS `*`) config would
//     otherwise let through a preflight. Such a request is origin-checked, not
//     exempted, so the dodge fails regardless of CORS config.
//   - Otherwise the browser's Sec-Fetch-Site (which page JS cannot forge) is the
//     primary signal: same-origin and none pass; cross-site is rejected;
//     **same-site passes only if its Origin is an allowlisted dashboard origin**
//     — so a sibling subdomain (subdomain takeover, a user-content host) cannot
//     ride the same-site label plus the Lax cookie into a mutation. Sec-Fetch-
//     Site is absent only on pre-2020 browsers; there we fall back to the same
//     Origin allowlist (the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS list, so the two can't drift).
//   - A request carrying NEITHER Sec-Fetch-Site NOR Origin is allowed. This is
//     deliberately not fail-closed: a genuine cross-site attack requires a
//     browser, and every browser that can run the dashboard sets at least one of
//     those headers on a cross-site unsafe request — page JS cannot remove them.
//     So "neither present" means the caller is not a browser (curl, an SDK, a
//     server job); it holds no ambient cookie and cannot be the CSRF vector.
//     Failing closed here would only break non-browser callers for no gain.
//
// This guard belongs ONLY on the dashboard-serving route groups (/v1/auth and
// the cookie-or-bearer /v1 group). It must not wrap the Stripe webhook group
// (HMAC-authenticated, server-to-server, no Origin) or the unauthenticated
// public payment/invoice surfaces (they carry no operator session to abuse).
