// TestMain asserts that the WHOLE package-api test suite — every e2e test that
// drives the real router (TestE2E_FullBillingCycle, the members-invite flow, the
// test-mode flow, the self-host bootstrap flow) — produced ZERO uncovered
// mutations.
//
// This is the RUNTIME half of ADR-090's coverage model, and it is only possible
// because these tests go through NewServer: the AuditCoverage detector is mounted
// at the root there, so every mutating request they make is classified for real
// (2xx + no audit row + not declared exempt ⇒ reported). The BUILD-TIME half —
// the route-audit registry's two-way diff against the live chi route table
// (audit_routes_test.go) — proves every mutating route is DECLARED. This proves
// the declarations are not lies on the paths the suite actually exercises: a
// route declared `explicit` whose emission silently stopped firing fails here,
// naming itself.
//
// It lives in TestMain rather than in one test so it cannot be forgotten when a
// new e2e test is added, and so it sees the union of every route the suite
// touches.
//
// If this fails: the named route committed a state change and left no audit
// evidence. Emit the row on the business transaction (audit.Logger.LogInTx) — or,
// if the request genuinely mutates nothing, declare that (audit.MarkSkip). Do not
// silence it by widening the registry's exempt set: exempt means "this route
// deliberately writes no audit row," which is a claim a reviewer must agree with.
