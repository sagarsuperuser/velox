internal/api/audit_routes.go (auditRouteRegistry):

    transaction (audit.Logger.LogInTx on the caller's *sql.Tx) so the mutation and
    its evidence commit or roll back together (ADR-090), and name the emission
    site in the note.

  • exempt(reason, note) — the route deliberately writes no audit row. reason must
    be one of the closed enum (non_mutating_preview, machine_ingest,
    system_endpoint, webhook_owned, bootstrap), and the note must say WHY and
    record any accepted loss.

compliance log, the row you didn't write is not recoverable later.`,
