# Money-Path Robustness Playbook

A runbook for building and reviewing any change that touches money or a state
machine (invoices, payments, credits, dunning, subscriptions, tax). It exists
because these bugs don't show up in a happy-path read — they live in *sibling*
call sites, *concurrent* interleavings, and *crash windows*.

**The motivating lesson (PR #325).** A dunning resolve change was reviewed four
times; each round caught a *different* instance of the *same* root problem, and
each fix exposed the next. The failure wasn't "review harder" — it was reasoning
*locally* (about the function in the diff) when the real surface was the whole
state machine: every writer, every effect-firer, every gated reader, every crash
point. This playbook makes that enumeration a checklist instead of a four-round
discovery.

When the design or review stage runs as a multi-agent panel/workflow, prompt
the agents per [agent-prompting-standards.md](agent-prompting-standards.md)
(grounded claims, reason-with-request, effort routing, the optional mid-build
spec-conformance verifier).

Pre-launch posture: **guard the money invariants, don't gold-plate.** Every rule
below is anchored to real Velox code — copy the pattern, don't reinvent it.

## 1. The failure-class map

The complete set of ways a billing engine silently does the wrong thing with
money. Each class has a *different fix kind* and a *different detection method* —
that's why they're separate.

| # | Class | Invariant | Fix kind | Velox example |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **A** | **Exactly-once / idempotency** | Every money mutation is idempotent-by-construction or dedup-key-guarded | dedup index / CAS / stable Stripe key | proration `idx_invoices_proration_dedup` → `invoice_proration_source_taken`; MarkPaid no-op re-read branch (avoids `amount_paid=amount_due` re-zero) |
| **B** | **Dual-write atomicity** | Internal state + its coupled effect never diverge | coordinator-tx (internal, ADR-056) / outbox-in-tx (external, ADR-040); reconciler is the *fallback* | `invoice.paid`+`payment.succeeded` enqueue **in** the MarkPaid tx; cancel final-bill folded into the cancel tx (#307) |
| **C** | **External-truth / webhooks** | Stripe (signed webhook or server response) is the *sole* money-outcome authority; ingestion is idempotent + order-insensitive; never mark money-state from a browser redirect | write the dedup row **last** (after the effect commits); 5xx to force redelivery | dedup row after effect (`row present ⇒ effect committed`); hosted-pay `?status=success` is cosmetic only |
| **D** | **Concurrency races (C1–C4)** | A transition is one atomic CAS; every write/effect/action around it is proven safe | see the C1–C4 sub-table | `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` gates + `ResolveRun WHERE state<>'resolved'` |
| **E** | **Partial-failure & loud-fail** | A mid-flow crash is recoverable (record-before-effect + requeryable state, or one atomic tx); every money error is surfaced; **no comment claims a backstop that doesn't exist** | in-tx / requeryable state / ERROR+operator path | test-clock panic → `internal_failure` on a `WithoutCancel` ctx; PaymentUnknown loud-fail CRITICAL-with-PI |
| **F** | **Incomplete-set read** | An effect that spans a *set* must read the *whole* set — no `LIMIT 1` over what is plural | fan-out query over the true set | single-source `FindBaseInvoiceForPeriod` missed the mid-period upgrade sibling → **4 of 5** money bugs (#276/#277/#278) |
| **G** | **Lifecycle termination (liveness sink)** | Every run/subscription/invoice reaches a terminal state — no stuck-active, no infinite retry, never escalate/cancel a paid customer | ensure a writer advances *every* reachable state to terminal | card-less `auto_charge_pending` retried forever (#297); exhaustRun set `escalated` even when the mover failed (#299) |
| **H** | **Tenant/livemode isolation** | Every `tenant_id` table has RLS `ENABLE`+**`FORCE`**+policy; app runs as non-superuser `velox_app` (fail-closed); scope is server-derived, never client-supplied; every `TxBypass` carries explicit `WHERE tenant_id` | migration adds RLS in the same PR; `openAppPool` role swap | 45 tables covered; `os.Exit(1)` refuses to boot RLS-bypassed in non-local |
| **I** | **Time / precision / validation** | Month/year math anchored in tenant TZ (never host `time.Local`); simulated vs wall-clock never cross-compare; int64 cents with `RoundHalfToEven` (no float); currency UPPERCASE at store; malformed input fails loud; a call that never reached the provider isn't a burned attempt | `addIntervalIn` / `time.Now().UTC()` both sides / `ErrTransientSkip` | tenant-TZ `domain.addIntervalIn` (ADR-058); `ErrTransientSkip` rewinds the attempt |
| **J** | **Contracted-instant stamping** | A transition executed LATE (catchup sweep, background settle, webhook, operator retry) stamps the instant it was *contracted* to fire — never the executor's effective-now; purely operational stamps (`issued_at`, `updated_at`, audit recorded-at) stay at effective-now. One advance crossing N boundaries produces N artifacts each at its own boundary instant | plumb the contracted instant INTO the writer (an `at` param like `resolveRunAt`; a `WithSim` ctx rebind per boundary; a PI-metadata anchor across the provider round-trip) — never re-resolve `clock.Now()` at the write site | **6 sightings before mechanizing**: trial flips, boundary cancels (ADR-097), pause resumes (#516), dunning resolves + success retry rows (#520), retry-charge ctx (#523), `paid_at` via `velox_anchor_at` (#523) |

### The C1–C4 concurrency sub-table (class D)

| | Class | Tell | Fix |
|--|-------|------|-----|
| **C1** | Non-idempotent effect under a **new caller** *or* a **crash-retry** | an effect (`fireEvent`/`Dispatch`/email/Stripe call) fires unconditionally after a state write | fire **only on the winning CAS branch** (`RowsAffected==1`) *and/or* carry an internal dedup/source key |
| **C2** | Incomplete invariant rollout | a new guard/chokepoint is added, but not every writer routes through it | enumerate ALL writers, route each through the one chokepoint |
| **C3** | Unguarded write racing a transition | `UPDATE … WHERE id=$X` with no state predicate | state-predicate `WHERE … AND status=<expected>` + `RowsAffected` gate |
| **C4** | Irreversible action on a **stale precondition** | a tick-start / handler-start check that goes stale across a Stripe (or DB) round-trip | re-read the precondition **immediately before** the irreversible action |

> **C3 and C4 are one root** — *check-then-act across a gap* (a concurrent-tx gap
> vs. a slow-external-call gap). The single scanning heuristic — "is the
> precondition re-asserted atomically at the moment of the write/action?" —
> catches both.

## 2. The meta-practice: complete-site-set enumeration

**Never reason locally about a money/state change. Enumerate its complete
site-set and prove each element covered before writing a line.** This one
discipline collapses PR #325's four rounds into a single pass, because the racing
firer, the clobbering write, and the stale-gated action all live in sibling
branches and callees a diff-scoped read never opens.

Make the **state value** (`'resolved'`, `SubscriptionActive`, …) — not your diff
— the unit of proof. For the state machine you touch, list and discharge:

1. **Every WRITER** of this state (handler, service, engine, scheduler, webhook,
   operator action, reconciler). Do they ALL route through the one guarded
   transition chokepoint? *(`ResolveRun` has six resolve paths, all funneled
   through `resolveRunNow`; a seventh site that writes the state directly is the
   bug — cf. `subscription.Activate`, the one status-flip that bypasses
   `transitionInTx`.)*
2. **Every EFFECT-FIRER** hanging off the transition (Stripe call, ledger write,
   email, outbound webhook). Is each idempotent under replay, and either in-tx or
   outbox-enqueued?
3. **Every CALLER and CALLEE.** Does a `*Tx` variant skip a validation or effect
   the non-Tx path runs? *(the pre-#333 `UpsertPolicyTx`, which skipped the
   retry-schedule-length check `UpsertPolicy` enforced — both writers now share
   the `normalizeAndValidatePolicy` chokepoint.)* Does the guard extend into functions the changed
   one *calls*? *(the exhaustRun miss.)*
4. **Every precondition-check-vs-external-call GAP.** Between the check and the
   irreversible action, can a concurrent settle/redelivery invalidate it?
5. **Every CRASH POINT.** For the line *after* each commit, name the exact
   reconciler row / outbox obligation / marker column that re-drives the missing
   effect — and **open it** to confirm it sweeps THIS state.

Write the site-set as a checklist in the PR description and check each box
**against grep output**, not against memory:

```
grep -n "TxTenant\|MarkPaid\|resolveRunNow\|transitionInTx\|\.Dispatch(\|fireEvent" internal/<domain>/
```

If a new writer can't reuse the existing chokepoint (`transitionAtomic`,
`resolveRunNow`, `MarkPaid*Transition`), **create or extend the chokepoint first,
then add the caller** — never hand-roll a fresh `UPDATE`+effect.

---

## 3. Implementation checklist — gates before opening a money-path PR

Ordered by leverage. A "no" blocks the PR.

1. **Dedup primitive chosen at design time?** Client write → `/v1`
   Idempotency-Key middleware. Server/engine/scheduler/webhook write → a
   `source_*` partial-unique dedup index OR a same-tx CAS. **Never rely on the
   API header for engine paths** — they carry none.
2. **Stripe idempotency key is provenance-stable, not a fresh UUID?** Derived
   from the durable id you dedup on (`velox_inv_<id>_<UpdatedAt>`, `velox_cn_<id>`,
   `inv_taxrev_<id>`); can't collide across purposes (finalize vs dunning suffix)
   nor dedup two genuinely-different charges.
3. **Coupled effect classified and placed?** Internal DB write → threaded
   `*sql.Tx` in-tx (ADR-056). External call → `OutboxStore.Enqueue(ctx, tx, …)`
   in the commit tx (ADR-040), or a self-clearing marker column + scheduler sweep.
4. **The UPDATE itself is idempotent?** No-op re-read branch when the transition
   already ran (guard the `amount_paid=amount_due` re-zeroing class); CAS is
   `WHERE state<>target` and `RowsAffected`-gated.
5. **Webhook: the dedup-row write (`IngestEvent`) is the LAST write, after the
   effect commits?** Only never-processable errors (`ErrNotFound`) ack; everything
   else returns 5xx to force redelivery. No money-state from a browser redirect.
6. **Irreversible action re-reads its precondition immediately before firing?**
   Cancel/void/pause/uncollectible re-fetch terminal STATUS (not a stale
   pre-read), falling through on a fetch error so a DB blip never burns it.
7. **Every money-path error is loud?** No `_ =` / `_, _ =` on a store write or
   `Dispatch`. WARN→ERROR when sustained failure means under-collected money.
8. **Every background goroutine/worker/advance wrapped in `recover()`** that flips
   the entity to a *requeryable terminal* state (`MarkFailed` on a `WithoutCancel`
   ctx), never leaving it in-progress with no operator exit.
9. **New `tenant_id` table? Same migration adds `ENABLE` + `FORCE` +
   `tenant_isolation`.** `ENABLE`-without-`FORCE` exempts the owner (the 0111 bug).
   Every new `TxBypass`/`db.Pool` query carries explicit `WHERE tenant_id` (+
   `livemode`).
10. **Time/money hygiene:** every +1mo/+1yr goes through
    `domain.addIntervalIn`/`AddBillingInterval` with tenant loc; any TTL/staleness
    compare uses `time.Now().UTC()` on **both** sides (never `clock.Now(ctx)` vs a
    DB-`now()` column — the tax-commit bug shape); no `float64` reaches cents;
    currency written only at the `ToUpper` store chokepoint.
11. **Validation enforced at EVERY save entrypoint** including the Tx/recipe/bulk
    variant — if a Tx-variant skips it "because upstream validated," point at the
    exact upstream check for each invariant.
12. **Grep your own diff** for `catchup will retry` / `next cycle` / `reconciler
    will catch` / `EnqueueStandalone` / `_ =` on side-effects — and prove each
    named backstop EXISTS and sweeps this state.

---

## 4. Review lens — questions that INDEPENDENTLY re-derive each invariant

Don't accept "none of X can Y." Run the greps yourself; make the author's proof
land on the table.

- **A (exactly-once):** "What is the dedup key for THIS write, and is it stable
  across (a) at-least-once redelivery, (b) a crash between the Stripe call and the
  DB commit, and (c) two concurrent callers? If the answer is 'the CAS already
  guarantees exactly-once' with no atomic internal effect, an atomic option was
  skipped."
- **B (dual-write):** "Does the internal side-effect share the state-change tx
  (grep the `*sql.Tx` param), or run post-commit? If post-commit, is it a durable
  enqueued obligation/marker, or a fire-and-forget a crash loses? Show me the
  `Enqueue`-in-tx before the `.Dispatch(`."
- **C (webhooks):** "If Stripe redelivers this exact event after `processEvent`
  committed but `IngestEvent` failed, does re-running double-count money or
  re-fire an outbound event? Does any money-state come from a browser redirect?"
- **D (concurrency):** "Show me the writer set (`grep` every `UPDATE` of this
  column — does each carry a state predicate + `RowsAffected` gate?). Trace each
  effect up to its CAS. Where was the precondition last read relative to the
  irreversible action?"
- **E (partial-failure):** "If the process crashes on the line AFTER this commit,
  name the exact reconciler/outbox row/marker that re-drives the effect — and open
  it to confirm it re-visits THIS state. Is this error `_ =` swallowed? Is it WARN
  where sustained failure = lost money?"
- **F (incomplete-set):** "What query anchors this effect, and is its result set
  complete? Any `LIMIT 1` or single-status predicate over what is actually plural
  (multiple funding invoices per period; orphan paid/void/uncollectible rows)?"
- **G (liveness):** "Does every reachable state have a writer that advances it to
  terminal? What happens to this entity if the terminal action *fails*?"
- **H (isolation):** "Does every `tenant_id` table this diff touches have BOTH
  `ENABLE` and `FORCE` + a policy? Any new `TxBypass`/`db.Pool` query — explicit
  `WHERE tenant_id AND livemode`? Does any `BeginTx(TxTenant, X)` take X from
  request input rather than the auth-derived ctx?"
- **I (time/precision/validation):** "Does this time compare put `clock.Now(ctx)`
  on one side and a DB-`now()`/Stripe timestamp on the other? Does any advance skip
  `addIntervalIn`? Does a `float64` reach cents? Which entrypoints reach this store
  write, and does EACH run the same validation? For an external 5xx/timeout where
  the effect *may* have happened — is it counted as a real attempt?"

## 5. Test-lock doctrine

**MUST be an automated test** (per the MANUAL_TEST `[x]` durable rule):
(i) **concurrency** — always; (ii) **money-invariant** — automate unless it's an
Nth duplicate of a proven pattern; (iii) **partial-failure / crash-between-writes.**
**Manual `[~]`** only for observable/UI/live-external surfaces (live-Stripe
exactly-once stays manual).

Five non-negotiable patterns:

1. **Collision, not happy-path.** Fire the SAME mutation twice — concurrently AND
   serially — assert exactly-one effect + the SPECIFIC dedup error code
   (`invoice_proration_source_taken`, `credit_reversal_source_taken`). Assert the
   re-run invariant explicitly: second MarkPaid leaves `amount_paid` unchanged;
   second credit-apply drains 0. *Pattern:*
   `internal/invoice/postgres_proration_dedup_integration_test.go`,
   `internal/billing/engine_idempotency_integration_test.go`.
2. **Real Postgres, the DB did the filtering.** Atomicity: force the second leg to
   fail inside the tx, assert the FIRST leg rolled back (row absent) — what
   #307/#309/#312 shipped. RLS: open `TxTenant(A)`, write, then assert
   `TxTenant(B)` sees ZERO rows **with no `WHERE` clause in the query** (proving
   the DB, not the SQL, filtered). A schema test enumerating `information_schema`
   for every `tenant_id` table + asserting `relrowsecurity AND
   relforcerowsecurity` in `pg_class` catches every future 0111-class RLS slip
   automatically.
3. **Concurrent-resolver / fault-injecting fake.** A test double that, at the
   external-call boundary or between the precondition read and the write,
   *concurrently commits the racing transition* (pays/cancels/resolves the
   target). Assert BOTH outcomes: winner did the effect exactly once (assert the
   *count*, not just final state); loser took the `RowsAffected==0` branch — no
   second fire, no clobber. *Pattern:* `resolvingCanceler`/`resolvingRetrier` in
   the dunning tests, `TestResolveRun_CAS_ExactlyOnce`. A test asserting only "no
   error returned" is vacuous.
4. **Mutation-verify the guard is non-vacuous.** Temporarily revert the `WHERE`
   predicate / the CAS gate / the re-read and confirm the test goes **red**. The
   red run is the *only* proof the guard exists rather than being decorative — and
   it's what a later refactor that re-introduces an unconditional fire or a second
   tx trips over in CI. (PR #325 shipped a 5-mutation check.)
5. **One advance, many boundaries (class J).** Drive a test clock across ≥2
   contracted instants in a SINGLE advance (two retry dates; a resume date plus a
   cycle close) and assert each artifact — `resolved_at`, `paid_at`, timeline
   rows, the charge ctx's `Sim.At` — stamps ITS OWN boundary instant, none the
   advance-end frozen time. Asserting only the final state is vacuous: the sweep
   reaches it either way; the *instants* are what regress. *Pattern:*
   `TestProcessDueRunsForClock_RecoveryStampsContractedInstant`,
   `TestProcessDueRunsForClock_ChargeCtxCarriesAnchoredInstant`.

## 6. Current posture (as of 2026-07-11)

**Update (2026-07-11).** Since the 2026-07-02 census below: the simulated-data
lifecycle became its own design-of-record (**ADR-086** — is_simulated gates on
all five wall-clock money sweeps, clock teardown, branded `EffectiveNow` on the
FE; supersedes ADR-016); the HA/N=2 posture is documented in
`ha-readiness-2026-07-06.md` (10 hazards, 17 verified-safe; build trigger =
production cutover); and the 2026-07-10 design-quality review
(`design-review-2026-07-10.md`) shipped a fix-now batch (#427–#440) including
the `domain.TaxFacts` embed (class-A/B adjacent: the tax-fact field-drop class
is now a compile error), typed effect outcomes (`domain.NotifyOutcome` — a
skipped effect is never a silent nil), and fail-loud parity on the cancel
builder. A proposed **rendered/asserted-truth class** and the
containment trip-wire live in that review, still pending adoption here (the
review called it "class J", but that letter has since been taken by the adopted
class J, contracted-instant stamping — see §1).

## 6a. Census posture (as of 2026-07-02)

Classes **A** (exactly-once), **B** (money-event dual-writes), **D** (concurrency
C1–C4), and **H** (tenant isolation) are locked and test-covered — don't
re-litigate them. Every MEDIUM finding from the original census has shipped:

- ~~`subscription.Activate` lost-update~~ — **fixed #327**: `Update` now carries
  `AND status='draft'` + an `ErrNoRows` re-query → `InvalidState` conflict,
  matching the `transitionInTx` chokepoint its siblings use. Locked by the
  real-Postgres `TestActivate_StoreUpdate_GuardsAgainstConcurrentCancel`
  (mutation-verified).
- ~~`SettleFailed` dunning crash-window~~ — **fixed #328**: the `dunning_backfill`
  reconciler (`Engine.EnrollFailedWithoutDunning`) re-drives the idempotent
  `StartDunning` for failed invoices with no run (state-agnostic `NOT EXISTS`,
  0085-exactly-once). **ADR-064** ratifies the triggered-primary +
  derived-backstop architecture; **#330** additionally moved the `payment.failed`
  event into the fail-tx (outbox, gated on `firstForThisPI`).
- ~~`dashboard_sessions` no RLS~~ — **fixed #331 (m0124)**, which also fenced
  `user_tenants` — a second unfenced table **found by the new
  `TestRLSIsolation_EveryTenantTableIsFenced`** (the §5.2 enumeration test, now
  built: discovers every `tenant_id` table from `information_schema`, asserts
  `ENABLE`+`FORCE`+policy, empty reason-required allowlist). The manual audit
  sweep had missed `user_tenants` — enumeration beats lists; the whole
  missing-RLS class is now CI-caught.

The LOW residue is closed too — **the census is fully discharged**:

- ~~`UpsertPolicyTx` validation parity~~ — **fixed #333**: both policy writers
  route through one shared `normalizeAndValidatePolicy` chokepoint, so a
  mismatched recipe fails at instantiate-time, not mid-campaign. Locked by
  `TestUpsertPolicyTx_ValidationParity` (mutation-verified).
- ~~64KB webhook-body truncation~~ — **fixed #334**: an over-cap body is
  detected (read cap+1) and rejected as 413 `payload_too_large` with a size
  diagnostic, instead of truncating → HMAC-failing → a misleading
  "invalid signature" 400. Locked by
  `TestWebhookHandler_OversizedBodyIs413NotSignatureFailure` (mutation-verified).

Deferred-with-trigger and honestly documented (do not re-flag): the failed
customer **email** post-commit best-effort (by design — symmetric to the receipt
email; the *event* is in-tx since #330); `EventDispatcher.Dispatch` no-`*sql.Tx`
for ~16 *notification* webhooks (zero consumers, no money event affected);
`relieveUnpaidPrebill` unpaid-branch post-commit; exhaustRun's 24h self-heal
re-attempting a permanently-failing mover unbounded (the deliberate
"keep requeryable" tradeoff); `RetryPendingTaxCommitForClock` absent (test-mode
only — clock-pinned ⇒ `livemode=false` by CHECK constraint, no real-VAT exposure);
a durable `collection_failed_at` anchor + the ADR-062 queue (see ADR-064's
cheap-strengthening triggers).
