# Velox — Self-host

Velox runs as a single Go binary against Postgres. The supported deployment
shape today is Docker Compose on a single VM. A managed-Kubernetes path
(Helm chart, multi-replica HA, Terraform-as-IaC) is not in v1; it lands
when a design partner names which Kubernetes flavour they actually run.

## Deploying (single-VM compose stack)

**The canonical walkthrough is
[`deploy/compose/README.md`](../deploy/compose/README.md)** — a
containerized four-service stack (postgres, redis, velox-api, nginx)
with its own `.env.example`. Five minutes from a fresh VM to a working
tenant: set four secrets, `docker compose up -d`, then one
`POST /v1/bootstrap` call returns your dashboard owner login and API
keys (test + live).

Everything below on this page is reference material — Postgres
requirements, env vars, scaling, observability — that applies to both
the compose stack and a hand-rolled install.

## Local development (host Go toolchain, not a deployment)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagarsuperuser/velox.git
cd velox

cp .env.example .env   # make dev reads it; local defaults work as-is
docker compose up -d postgres redis mailpit
VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL=you@example.com VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD=change-me-please1 \
  make bootstrap
make dev
```

(`VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL`/`VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` are optional — bootstrap
defaults the owner to `admin@velox.local` and prints a generated password.
Passwords must be at least 12 characters.)

That gives you:

- `postgres` on `:5432` (volume-backed, password `velox`)
- `redis` on `:6379` (used by the rate limiter)
- `mailpit` on `:1025` SMTP / `:8025` web UI (catches outbound transactional mail)
- `velox-api` on `:8080` (from `make dev`, not a container)

The dashboard:

```bash
cd web-v2 && npm install && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

## Operational posture

This deployment shape is a **single-VM, single-instance** install:

- API: 1 `velox-api` process. Restart and you have downtime until it
  comes back up.
- DB: 1 Postgres instance on the same host (or a managed Postgres if you
  point `DATABASE_URL` elsewhere).
- Scheduler: in-process goroutine inside `velox-api` (per ADR-006). One
  scheduler at a time; safe because there's only one API process.
- LB: none.

This is appropriate for: development, evaluation, single-tenant
self-hosting where ~minutes of downtime per deploy/restart is acceptable.
It is **not** a production-with-availability shape — for that, the next
step is a multi-replica deployment with leader-elected scheduling and
managed Postgres. That work is paused until a design partner with a
specific Kubernetes flavour comes through; pre-emptively shipping three
independent deployment paths produced surface nobody was running.

## Postgres

Compose ships Postgres 16 with default settings — sufficient for eval.
For your own VM:

- Version: 16.x
- Extensions: none required (Velox uses standard `gen_random_bytes`,
  `LATERAL`, RLS — all built-in).
- **A least-privilege runtime role (required for tenant isolation).**
  Velox enforces multi-tenant isolation with Row-Level Security. Request
  traffic runs on the connection in `APP_DATABASE_URL` — a role like
  `velox_app` with its own password, NOT the admin role. The compose
  stack creates it from `VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD`
  ([`deploy/compose/postgres-init.sh`](../deploy/compose/postgres-init.sh));
  on your own Postgres:

  ```sql
  -- use psql -v pw='...' and :'pw' quoting, or substitute a literal
  CREATE ROLE velox_app WITH LOGIN PASSWORD :'pw';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE velox TO velox_app;
  GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO velox_app;
  ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO velox_app;
  ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO velox_app;
  ```

  **With `APP_ENV=staging` or `production`, Velox refuses to start**
  (ADR-073) when `APP_DATABASE_URL` is missing, carries the default
  password `velox_app` (or an empty one), can't be opened, or points at
  a role that can bypass RLS (superuser/`BYPASSRLS` — the boot check
  catches a copied `DATABASE_URL`). In `local` it derives
  `velox_app:velox_app` from `DATABASE_URL` and warns instead, since a
  single-tenant dev box often uses one superuser URL.
- Backups: take a `pg_dump` snapshot on whatever cadence your data loss
  tolerance allows. Stripe's webhook outbox + Velox's audit log are the
  two surfaces where lost rows are most expensive; both are covered by a
  consistent snapshot.

## Migrations

`RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_BOOT=true` (default for `make dev`) runs forward
migrations on startup. Migrations are versioned and idempotent
([`internal/platform/migrate/sql/`](../internal/platform/migrate/sql/)).
Down-migrations exist for development reversal but production rollbacks
are forward-only.

## Environment

Required:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres DSN — admin/migration role |
| `APP_DATABASE_URL` | Postgres DSN — least-privilege `velox_app` runtime role (RLS enforced). Required in `staging`/`production`; local dev derives `velox_app:velox_app` from `DATABASE_URL` when unset |

Bootstrap-time (read by `make bootstrap` / `cmd/velox-bootstrap`, not the server):

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL` | Dashboard owner email (default `admin@velox.local`) |
| `VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` | Owner password (unset → generated and printed once) |
| `VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_TENANT` | Tenant name (default `Demo Tenant`) |

Optional:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_BOOT` | `false` | Run migrations on startup (racing replicas serialize on an advisory lock and skip already-applied work) |
| `APP_ENV` | `local` | `local`/`staging`/`production`. Gates the cookie `Secure` flag and the fail-closed boot checks — `staging`/`production` refuse to start without a valid `APP_DATABASE_URL` (see Postgres above) and refuse a `VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` under 16 chars |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | _(unset)_ | Comma-separated proxy IPs/CIDRs whose `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` are trusted for client-IP resolution (rate limiting, audit logs). Unset = headers ignored, direct TCP peer used |
| `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | Canonical dashboard origin for password-reset links. **Unset disables password-reset emails** — the origin is never derived from request headers (host-header poisoning). Set to e.g. `http://localhost:5173` in dev |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` | _(unset)_ | Outbound email relay. Unset → emails are not sent (`ErrSMTPNotConfigured`). The compose path points these at mailpit (`localhost:1025`) |

Stripe is configured per-tenant via the dashboard (`POST /v1/settings/stripe`), not env vars — each tenant connects their own Stripe account.

## Scaling considerations

Single-replica is fine to ~tens of millions of usage events per month
on a 4-vCPU VM with 8 GB RAM. Beyond that the bottleneck is usually the
per-cycle aggregation scan; Postgres tuning (`work_mem`,
`shared_buffers`, an index review on `usage_events(tenant_id,
ingested_at)`) gets you another order of magnitude.

The ceiling on single-replica is the in-process scheduler — when one API
process can no longer keep up with the cycle scan plus webhook delivery,
that's the trigger for the multi-replica work currently paused.

## Observability

Velox exposes Prometheus metrics on `/metrics` and structured logs to
stdout. Hook these into whatever stack you already run; the v1 install
does not ship a Grafana / Prometheus / Alertmanager bundle (deferred —
local dev observability is `tail -f` on the API logs).

Key metrics to watch:

- `velox_billing_cycle_duration_seconds` — cycle scan latency
- `velox_tax_outcome_total{outcome,reason}` — tax-provider failure modes
- `velox_audit_write_errors_total` — audit log write failures
- `velox_stripe_breaker_state` — Stripe API circuit breaker (1 = open)
