# ADR-066: Threshold money semantics — prorated reset base, atomic fire→reset, $0 auto-pay, max/last deferral

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Status:** Accepted (fixes 4/atomicity/6 shipped in P1b; fix 5 semantics decided here, implementation lands in P1c)

## Context

ADR-065 fixed the threshold-scan *kernel* (boundary-skip, fire-once probe,
cursor-drain). This ADR records the *money semantics* of the remaining
P1 defects, as decided by the build-time adversarial panel (three lenses:
money-correctness/accounting-identity, concurrency/crash/retry,
operator-semantics/industry-parity — all returned SHIP-WITH-FIXES and
materially amended the plan's §4.1 sketch; plan doc updated same-day).

## Decisions

### 1. reset=true fires bill a PRORATED in_arrears base (shipped, P1b)

With `reset_billing_cycle=true` the fire re-anchors the cycle at the fire
instant, so the cycle close never true-ups the fired window's base — the
threshold invoice IS that window's base bill. It used to carry the FULL
month's base: a sub crossing 3×/month paid base 3×.

**The denominator is the plan's own full interval, never the current period
length.** The panel rejected the plan's sketched
`roundDays(periodEnd−periodStart)`: it violates the codebase's proration
invariant (`domain/subscription.go` — divide by the FULL cycle length),
over-bills re-anchored stubs (+43% at one observed point), mid-cycle-created
periods (up to ~2×), cross-interval items (~12× for a yearly-interval line on
a monthly-period sub), and divides by zero on a sub-day stub. The shipped
formula mirrors `emitBaseSegmentLine` per line:

```
fullCycleDays = roundDays(advanceBillingPeriod(periodStart, linePlan.BillingInterval, loc, anchorDay) − periodStart)
segDays       = roundDays(now − periodStart)          // capped at fullCycleDays
prorated      = RoundHalfToEven(base × qty × segDays, fullCycleDays)
```

The whole line triple is rewritten — description gains the standard
`(prorated X/Y days)` suffix and the unit amount is recomputed — so
`qty × unit == amount` on every render surface. The prorated amount feeds the
`amount_gte` running total (the invoice matches the cap comparison).
`reset=false` behavior is byte-identical (the cycle close bills the residual
and skips base behind the watermark — full base on the fire stays correct).

**Accepted conventions:** day granularity (a sub-day window prorates to a $0
base stub, matching the engine-wide `roundDays` convention); across N fires
the independently-rounded numerators may drift the cycle's total base by up
to ±1 day's base per fire boundary; `POST /v1/invoices/create_preview` is
untouched (public surface, and the reset=false close-path base-skip depends
on it) — a preview over a reset=true sub shows the full base while the fire
would bill prorated. Documented divergence, same shape as Stripe's upcoming-
invoice preview not modeling threshold fires.

### 2. Fire→reset is ONE transaction (shipped, P1b)

`fireThreshold` committed the invoice, then ran tax-commit / credits /
charge / events, and only then `UpdateBillingCycle` — with the failure arm
logging and returning success under a "next tick reconciles" comment that
was false: the fire-once probe finds the committed invoice and skips every
later tick, so a crash or transient failure between the writes stranded the
reset FOREVER. Under decision 1 that degrades to permanent base
under-billing (prorated base on the invoice, full base skip at close).

Now the insert and re-anchor commit atomically via the engine's `TxRunner`
seam (`postgres.DB.WithTenantTx`; both stores' `…Tx` variants already
existed). Failure rolls both back — the probe stays clear and the next tick
retries the whole fire. External calls stay post-commit (the tx never spans
network I/O — deliberate; see the batch-claim design discussion in ADR-065's
lineage). A missing TxRunner on a reset fire fails loudly; there is no
sequential fallback.

### 3. $0 invoices auto-mark paid, both writers + heal (shipped, P1b)

The zero-due MarkPaid gates in `fireThreshold` AND `billOnePeriod` required
`totalWithTax > 0`, stranding invoices born $0 (zero-priced usage lines
crossing a `usage_gte` cap; free-rated plans) as payment_pending forever —
never charged, never paid, permanently "awaiting payment" in the attention
queue. Both gates are now `creditApplyOK && status == finalized`. Stripe
parity verified by the panel: zero-amount invoices auto-mark paid with no
payment attempt; `invoice.paid` fires (consumers should read it as
"settled", not "money received"). Tax-pending and pause-collection drafts
remain excluded by the status gate.

**Heal-on-re-entry:** a crash between create and MarkPaid re-enters only
through the fire-once probe (threshold) or the ErrAlreadyExists branch
(cycle) — neither reached the gate again. Both paths now run an idempotent
`healStrandedZeroDue` (probe fetches the full row via
`GetLatestThresholdInvoiceForCycle`; the cycle branch via
`GetInvoiceForPeriod`, the exact billing-idempotency tuple). Best-effort by
design: a heal failure WARNs and leaves the operator-visible pending row
rather than blocking the cycle advance — stalling all future billing over a
$0 paid-mark is the worse trade.

### 4. max/last split-billing — semantics DECIDED, implementation in P1c

Non-additive aggregations (`max`, `last_during_period`, `last_ever` — the
original plan forgot `last_ever`) cannot be split across a threshold fire and
a cycle close: `max[0,t1) + max[t1,end) ≥ max[0,end)`. Decisions, recorded
now so P1c implements against them without re-litigating:

- **Exclusion iff `reset=false`** (locked earlier): drop non-additive lines
  from the threshold invoice; the cycle close bills them full-period exactly
  once. Under `reset=true` they ride the fire (the re-anchored stub never
  gets a close for the pre-fire window — excluding would bill them by
  NOBODY).
- **Granularity is the RULE BUCKET, not the meter.** One meter can carry sum
  and max rules simultaneously (`meter_pricing_rules.aggregation_mode`);
  meter-level classification preserves the exact split-billing bug on mixed
  meters. AggregationMode gets plumbed onto PreviewLine.
- **The close-side clamp exemption keys on INVOICE GROUND TRUTH** — "the
  watermark threshold invoice carries no line for this bucket" — never on
  `sub.BillingThresholds.ResetBillingCycle` at close time: the flag is
  operator-mutable between fire and close (a PATCH flip would resurrect the
  billed-by-nobody gap), and a stranded pre-ADR-066 reset makes it a lie.
- **Panel question (a): max/last amounts count toward `amount_gte` iff
  `reset=false`.** Asymmetric on purpose. Under reset=false the cap measures
  committed spend (for the AI-infra segment, max-metered GPU concurrency can
  be MOST of the spend) and the probe guarantees at most one fire per cycle.
  Under reset=true, counting them creates a runaway refire loop — a steady
  peak re-materializes in every re-anchored window: cross → fire + card
  charge → re-anchor → cross again, one invoice per scheduler tick.
- **Panel question (b): a pure-max/last crossing SKIPS** (no invoice — the
  billable set after exclusion is empty), with a loudness floor: the
  empty-set guard sits before any invoice-number mint or paid tax call, and
  emits a once-per-(sub, period) audit/timeline artifact + deduped WARN, not
  tick-spam. Residual-subtraction was rejected by all three lenses:
  meaningless for `last` (a point-in-time read is not subtractable),
  over-bills `max` when the peak straddles the fire, and produces an invoice
  no auditor can recompute. PATCH-time steering (warn when configuring
  `amount_gte` on a pure-max/last sub) is deferred — cross-domain seam;
  trigger = first operator confusion report.

### 5. Named site-set discoveries (panel), disposition

- **Immediate-cancel final bill ignores the threshold watermark** — a second
  period-closer the original design missed: after a reset=false fire, an
  immediate cancel double-bills the pre-fire sum usage + base. Fix lands in
  P1c by sharing the watermark protocol (base skip + additive clamp +
  non-additive exemption) between `billOnePeriod` and the cancel path via
  one helper.
- **`{in_advance base × reset=true}` under-bills** one base slice per fire
  on anniversary subs (the re-anchored period's pre-existing-prepaid window
  is never re-billed; calendar subs snap back and are unaffected).
  Customer-favored, rare, pre-existing. DOCUMENTED, not fixed in-window;
  trigger to revisit = first DP configuring reset=true on in_advance plans.

## Test locks (mutation- or fault-injection-verified)

Proration: `TestEvaluateThresholds_ResetProratesBase` (+ full-line-triple
assertions), `…_StubPeriodDenominator` (2333-vs-1633 seam),
`…_CrossIntervalDenominator` (10950-vs-900 seam),
`TestThresholdFire_ResetProratesBase_RealStore` (real preview path + persisted
lines + atomic re-anchor). Atomicity:
`TestThresholdFire_ResetAtomic_RollsBackOnAdvanceFailure` (real-PG rollback +
clean retry), `TestScanThresholds_ResetAdvanceFailure_IsLoud`,
`…_ResetWithoutTxRunner_FailsLoud`. $0: `TestFireThreshold_ZeroTotal_AutoPaid`,
`TestBillOnePeriod_ZeroTotal_AutoPaid`, both heal tests. The multi-fire
base-identity test (N prorated fires + close == exactly one base) needs
simulated time across re-anchors — lands with P1c's clock-driven suite.
