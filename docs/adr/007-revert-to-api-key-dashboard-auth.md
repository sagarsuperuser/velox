# ADR-007: Revert Dashboard to API-Key Auth

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-04-29

## Context

Velox's `project_auth_decision.md` and `CLAUDE.md` always recorded the v1 auth plan as: *"API keys custom-built; user auth via WorkOS/Clerk later; no premature session/password infrastructure."* The intent was that the dashboard, like the public HTTP API, would be authenticated by the operator's API key — one shared secret per tenant, no user accounts in v1.

Despite that, an embedded email+password auth stack landed in the codebase: migration `0034_embedded_auth.up.sql` (users, user_tenants, sessions tables), migration `0035_member_invitations.up.sql`, and the `internal/dashauth`, `internal/session`, `internal/user`, `internal/dashmembers` packages. The dashboard frontend grew matching pages: Login, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, AcceptInvite, Members. The decision document was never amended.

The deviation surfaced during a 2026-04-29 review when:
- The author asked for a brutal scope audit of features built ahead of evidence.
- Velox is local-only with one user account, zero design partners, zero contributors.
- A second class of memory entry (`feedback_amend_decisions_when_course_changes.md`) was added that explicitly names this anti-pattern.

The cost of carrying the home-grown stack forward is real: ~2k LOC of password hashing, session rotation, single-use token plumbing, timing-safe enumeration resistance, cookie security gating, member-invite flows, and the matching frontend. Every CVE in those primitives, every session-fixation discovery, every cookie misconfiguration is permanent maintenance load. Before any design partner has named the auth shape they need (Okta SSO? WorkOS? email+password? something else?), guessing is overhead.

## Decision

Revert the dashboard to API-key login. The operator pastes a `vlx_secret_…` key (printed by `make bootstrap` or visible on `/api-keys`) into a single-input login screen; the browser stores it in `localStorage` and rides every request as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. No cookies, no sessions, no users, no invitations.

The backend exposes a tiny `GET /v1/whoami` that returns `{tenant_id, key_id, key_type, livemode}` from the validated bearer-key context. The dashboard hits it once on login to validate the pasted key and populate the `AuthContext`; it requires no specific permission so any valid key (publishable or secret) passes.

Migrations `0034` and `0035` stay in place. Down-migrations are destructive (and would lose any `users`/`user_tenants`/`sessions` rows the local dev database happens to hold), and the unused tables are cheap. Re-introducing user accounts later — whether email+password again, Zitadel, or WorkOS — does not require a fresh schema; it requires a fresh decision.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Realigns execution with the documented v1 plan in `project_auth_decision.md`.
- Removes ~2k LOC and four packages from ongoing maintenance: `internal/dashauth`, `internal/session`, `internal/user`, `internal/dashmembers`. Frontend loses ForgotPassword / ResetPassword / AcceptInvite / Members pages.
- Eliminates cookie-security configuration as a footgun (no more `Secure` flag gating, `SameSite` decisions, CSRF surface).
- Single auth path on `/v1/*`. The previous `session.MiddlewareOrAPIKey` adapter — which accepted either a session cookie or a bearer token, with a livemode-disagreement check between the two — collapses to plain `auth.Middleware`. Less branching in handlers.
- One container in Docker Compose (Postgres + Redis + Mailpit + the API) — no need to recommend a sibling identity provider to OSS self-hosters.

### Negative

- Login UX is "paste this opaque key" instead of "email + password." For developers evaluating an OSS billing engine this is normal (Stripe Dashboard, AWS, GitHub PATs all train this gesture); for non-technical operators it's worse. Velox has no non-technical operators yet.
- No per-human attribution in the audit log — every action is attributed to the API key, not a named user. The audit-log handler already supports this via `actor_type='api_key'`; nothing breaks, but multi-human tenants will want named actors.
- No member invitations. A second human on the same tenant either receives the secret key (poor) or waits for a future re-introduction of user accounts (correct).
- API key in `localStorage` is XSS-readable. The dashboard ships with strict CSP and no third-party scripts to mitigate; even so, this is a downgrade vs `httpOnly` session cookies. Acceptable at v0 dashboard scope; revisit when a tenant has data the XSS-of-localStorage threat actually targets.

### Trade-offs

- Trades user-account UX (and the security primitives that go with it) for ~weeks of recovered focus on the AI-native wedge (multi-dim meters, per-token billing primitives, model-tier cost views) — the actual product differentiator.
- Trades the half-built sunk-cost stack for a clean v0 surface that's straightforward to replace whole-cloth with whatever the first design partner names — Zitadel, WorkOS, custom email+password again, or something else.

## Trigger to revisit

Reintroduce user accounts when **any one** of:
- A design partner is in the room and explicitly demands real user accounts (multi-human tenants, named audit attribution, SSO, MFA, etc.).
- A tenant onboards whose security review will not accept "API key in browser localStorage."
- Velox has more than one human operator using the same tenant in dev.

When that trigger fires, evaluate Zitadel and WorkOS first — both give the surface (sessions, MFA, SAML, invites) for the cost of one additional service, vs the home-grown stack we just removed. Re-deriving the email+password stack from scratch is the option of last resort.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Stay with the in-house email+password stack.** Rejected. Compounds a documented deviation rather than correcting it; carries ~2k LOC of maintenance for an audience of one; doesn't replace the eventual SSO/MFA conversation that any real design partner will trigger anyway.
- **Migrate to Zitadel now.** Rejected for current stage. Adds a sibling container to the OSS self-host story for a feature no current customer needs. The first DP may want WorkOS instead, or specifically not Zitadel; building the integration before knowing optimises the wrong shape. The right time is when the trigger above fires.
- **Add a one-shot CLI command that mints a session cookie from a `vlx_secret_…` key.** Rejected. Introduces a sidecar UX (run a CLI to log in) without gaining anything over Bearer-on-every-request. The dashboard already has `Authorization: Bearer` plumbing; adding a session layer on top is a half-revert.
