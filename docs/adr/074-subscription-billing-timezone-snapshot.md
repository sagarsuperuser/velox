# ADR-074: A subscription's billing timezone is snapshotted at creation, not read live

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Status:** Accepted (shipped as a pattern-copy of `billing_anchor_day`; the
adversarial design panel is a deliberate fast-follow, not a pre-gate — see
"Process" below)

## Context

Billing calendar date-math is anchored in a timezone (ADR-058): period
boundaries snap to civil midnight in that zone, and proration denominators
count days in it. Two halves define a subscription's calendar:

1. **The anchor DAY** — `billing_anchor_day`, persisted per-subscription
   (ADR-055) so a Jan-31 sub stably bills Jan 31 / Feb 28 / Mar 31 / ….
2. **The anchor TIMEZONE** — which, before this ADR, was read **live** from
   `tenant_settings.timezone` at every computation (`tenantLocation(ctx,
   tenantID)`), at ~23 call sites.

That split is a bug: the anchor is **half-frozen**. A subscription bills on
"the 1st," but "the 1st *in whichever timezone the tenant happens to have set
right now*." So changing the tenant timezone — a control that reads as
presentational — **silently re-times the future billing boundaries of
subscriptions that are already live**, and re-introduces exactly the
mixed-anchor drift ADR-058 exists to eliminate (a period anchored under UTC
rolling into an IST-anchored next period shifts by 5.5h, occasionally onto a
different calendar day, perturbing proration and revenue timing).

**Industry parity.** The mature model separates a *display* timezone (a lens;
changes freely, applies everywhere) from a *billing anchor* (immutable per
contract). Stripe anchors each subscription to a `billing_cycle_anchor` — a
stored Unix **instant**, never re-interpreted by a timezone setting. Chargebee
/ Zuora treat the site timezone as a **setup-time** decision that is heavyweight
(or restricted) to change once live billing exists. Velox already froze the
anchor *day*; freezing the anchor *timezone* completes the model.

## Decision

1. **Snapshot `billing_timezone` per subscription at creation** — a new column,
   the peer of `billing_anchor_day`. `Create` stamps it once from the live
   tenant timezone (`loc.String()` — the canonical IANA name, or `"UTC"` for an
   unset/invalid tenant TZ: a concrete, immutable anchor). The pair
   `(billing_anchor_day, billing_timezone)` now fully and immutably defines the
   sub's calendar.
2. **All billing-math reads the snapshot, not the live tenant setting.** New
   `subscriptionLocation(ctx, sub)` helpers (on `Engine`, `subscription.Service`,
   and the subscription `Handler` as `subLoc`) return the sub's
   `BillingTimezone`, falling back to the **live tenant timezone only for
   legacy/unset rows** (so pre-migration subs are byte-for-byte unchanged).
   Every period-boundary and proration site was swapped from
   `tenantLocation(ctx, sub.TenantID)` → `subscriptionLocation(ctx, sub)`: 16 in
   `billing/engine.go`, 1 in `preview.go`, 2 in `threshold_scan.go`, 5 in
   `subscription/service.go` (Create is the ONE exception — it reads
   `tenantLocation` to snapshot), and **1 in `subscription/handler.go`** — the
   proration-denominator (`fullBillingCycleDays`) call that resolves the zone
   via the injected `TenantLocator`. That handler site is the subtle one: it
   uses a different mechanism than the direct `tenantLocation` calls, so only
   the full site-set audit caught it; missing it would have anchored the
   proration *denominator* to the live tenant TZ while the period *boundaries*
   used the snapshot — the exact mismatch this ADR prevents.
3. **Display stays live.** The two render sites (`invoice/service.go`
   `invoiceTimezone`, `pdf_context.go` period formatting) keep reading the live
   tenant timezone — a display lens over the immutable billing math.
4. **Migration 0133 backfills every existing subscription** with its tenant's
   *current* timezone, so in-flight subs get **zero behavior change**: their
   effective timezone at migration becomes their frozen anchor. Rows whose
   tenant has no timezone stay NULL and fall back (at read time) to the live
   tenant TZ, exactly as before.
5. **Re-anchor paths keep the original timezone.** A cross-interval plan swap or
   threshold reset recomputes the anchor *day* to "now" (ADR-055) but reads the
   sub's stored `BillingTimezone` — the sub's billing-calendar timezone is fixed
   at signup and never changes. (An explicit "re-adopt the current tenant TZ on
   re-anchor" is a possible future refinement; the immutable default is the safe
   one and is flagged for the fast-follow panel.)

**Net contract:** changing the tenant timezone is now **display-only for
running subscriptions** and a **default for new ones** — never a silent
re-timing of live contracts.

## Process

This shipped as an **Opus build with the adversarial panel as a fast-follow**,
a deliberate, noted deviation from the standing "panel before any money-path
build" rule. Justification: this is **pattern-replication, not novel design** —
it copies the already-shipped, proven `billing_anchor_day` snapshot into a
parallel `billing_timezone` column. The design risk (the part a panel de-risks)
is low; the real risk is **completeness**, which was controlled by the full
site-set audit + mutation-verified tests + edge-case coverage. A fresh-context
spec self-review ran before merge. The Fable panel remains a fast-follow to
adversarially sweep for a missed edge (backfill on unusual rows, DST
interactions) when credits return.

## Accepted residuals

- Re-anchor (swap/reset) keeps the original TZ rather than re-adopting the
  current tenant TZ (see decision 5) — deliberate; revisit if a DP needs it.
- An unset-tenant-TZ sub snapshots the concrete `"UTC"` (immutable), whereas the
  migration backfill leaves an unset-tenant sub NULL (falls back live). Both are
  correct-under-their-moment; the divergence only matters if a tenant sets a TZ
  *after* having created subs with no TZ, where the pre-existing subs correctly
  keep following live until they next re-anchor.

## Test locks (mutation-verified 2026-07-04)

Unit: snapshot-at-create (Kolkata; unset → "UTC"); `subscriptionLocation` returns
the snapshot despite a *changed* tenant setting AND the boundaries genuinely
differ (Kolkata vs New_York), so the assertion can't pass vacuously; empty-TZ
legacy row falls back to the live tenant TZ. Real-Postgres: the INSERT persists
`billing_timezone` (the memStore echoes fields — only a real round-trip catches
a dropped column, the Finding-1 `activated_at` trap) AND the snapshot survives a
real `tenant_settings.timezone` change. Mutations killed: revert
`subscriptionLocation` to the live read → immutability test fails; drop
`billing_timezone` from the INSERT → persistence test fails.
