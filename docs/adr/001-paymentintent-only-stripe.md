# ADR-001: PaymentIntent-Only Stripe Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-04-14

## Context
Velox is a usage-based billing engine that needs to collect payments from customers via Stripe. Stripe offers two paths: (1) use Stripe Billing/Invoicing, which handles invoice creation, payment collection, and dunning automatically, or (2) use the PaymentIntent API directly, managing invoices, dunning, and payment lifecycle ourselves.

Stripe Billing charges 0.5% on top of the standard processing fee. For a platform processing $10M/year in billing volume, that is $50K/year in additional fees passed through to our customers or absorbed. Since Velox is itself a billing engine, delegating invoice management to Stripe Billing would also create an awkward redundancy — two systems tracking the same invoices.

## Decision
Velox uses the Stripe PaymentIntent API exclusively. We create PaymentIntents with `Confirm: true` and `OffSession: true` against saved payment methods. Invoice lifecycle (draft, finalized, paid, voided), dunning (retry schedules, escalation), and payment status tracking are all managed by Velox.

The `payment.Stripe` adapter creates PaymentIntents with idempotency keys derived from invoice IDs (`velox_inv_{id}`), preventing duplicate charges on retries. Webhook handlers for `payment_intent.succeeded` and `payment_intent.payment_failed` close the loop — updating invoice payment status and triggering dunning on failures.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Eliminates the 0.5% Stripe Billing fee for all Velox tenants
- Full control over invoice presentation, numbering, PDF generation, and payment terms
- No split-brain between Stripe's invoice state and ours — Velox is the single source of truth
- Idempotent charge creation prevents duplicate PaymentIntents on retry

### Negative
- We own the entire dunning implementation: retry scheduling, escalation policies, email notifications
- Must handle edge cases Stripe Billing abstracts away: partial payments, webhook ordering, PI state transitions
- More surface area for payment-related bugs in a financially sensitive context

### Trade-offs
- More code to maintain in exchange for zero dependency on Stripe's billing opinions and pricing changes
- We accept the maintenance burden because billing logic is our core product, not a peripheral feature

## Alternatives Considered
- **Stripe Billing/Invoicing**: Rejected due to the 0.5% fee and redundant invoice management. Also creates tight coupling to Stripe's invoice model, limiting our ability to support alternative payment processors later.
- **Stripe Subscriptions API**: Rejected because Velox handles its own subscription lifecycle with usage-based metering. Stripe Subscriptions would fight our pricing models (tiered, graduated, volume, package).
- **Abstract payment provider interface**: Rejected for v1. Velox is Stripe-native today. Premature abstraction would add complexity without a concrete second provider to validate the interface against.
