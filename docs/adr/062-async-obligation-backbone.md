# ADR-062: Async obligation backbone — extend the outbox, not Temporal/River/pgx (build deferred)

**Date:** 2026-06-25
**Status:** Decided (design + build-vs-buy). **Build deferred** to a named trigger.

This ADR records a decision we are deliberately **not building yet**, so the
next session inherits the verdict instead of re-litigating Temporal vs River vs
a `database/sql`→pgx migration. ADR-061 forward-references it; this is that doc.

## Context

Velox runs **four bespoke re-drive sweeps** that each recover a post-commit
async side-effect that failed: tax-commit (#267 `RetryPendingTaxCommit`),
tax-reversal (#310 `RetryPendingTaxReversal`), clawback-issue (ADR-057
`RetryPendingClawbackIssue`), and CN-tax-reversal (PR2/ADR-061
`RetryPendingCreditNoteTaxReversal`). Each is the same machinery re-implemented:
a scheduler tick + leader gate + a `ListPendingX` scan + a `RetryX` loop + a
status/marker column + its own retry/aging semantics. That duplication grows
linearly with each new async effect.

The recognised industry consolidation is a **single durable, in-DB-transaction-
enqueued obligation queue** (verified 2026-06-25, deep-research wa8o61214:
River/Oban/Solid Queue are mainstream; the queue COMPLEMENTS — never replaces —
idempotency + reconciliation). The question: do we adopt a product (River /
Temporal), and do we migrate `database/sql`→pgx-native to unlock one?

Velox facts that decide it: `database/sql` over the `pgx/v5/stdlib` driver
(`*sql.DB`/`*sql.Tx`; the RLS tenant-isolation core is built on the `BeginTx`
wrapper — 60 non-test files / 385 query sites). We **already operate** a
transactional outbox (`webhook_outbox`, ADR-040): in-tx `Enqueue(ctx, tx, …)`,
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` draining, DLQ (15 attempts / ~72h backoff),
advisory-lock leader. It is wired as a **customer-notification fan-out**
(`dispatcher → svc.Dispatch → matchesEvent` against `'*'`/prefix subscriptions).

## Decision

**When we consolidate, build a SEPARATE `obligations` table (B2) that reuses the
`webhook_outbox` DRAIN machinery** — in-tx `Enqueue`, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
DLQ, advisory-lock leader, and the `billing.Reconciler` seam (#315) — with a
kind→handler registry that only ever calls **in-process** handlers reusing the
existing re-drive bodies. Effects enqueue an obligation IN their coordinator
`*sql.Tx`; the drainer dispatches by kind; the bespoke `ListPendingX` scan +
marker column are then deleted. Migrate the four re-drive sweeps one at a time —
the cheap, already-in-an-in-scope-tx effects (`clawback_issue`,
`cn_tax_reversal`) first; the post-commit `tax_commit`/`tax_reversal` LAST
(money-path surgery on the finalize/void paths where #267/#310/G1 already bit —
dual-run the bespoke sweep as a backstop during cutover, and don't inherit the
webhook DLQ's terminal-at-15 tuning for money kinds: a tax reversal must retry
until recovered, not dead-letter into a silent over-remit).

**Amended 2026-06-25: build shape flipped B1 → B2** (current-vs-queue decision
panel). The original lean was B1 — *generalise `webhook_outbox`* with an
internal/external discriminator. Rejected: `webhook_outbox` is a
customer-notification fan-out — `webhook.Service.Dispatch` writes a
customer/dashboard-visible event + an operator SSE frame, and `matchesEvent`
returns true on `'*'` for ANY event type — so an internal obligation sharing it
is one `Dispatch` call from leaking tax/refund payloads (`customer_id`, amounts,
intent ids) to customer endpoints, the worst bug class for a billing engine. A
discriminator would make that leak *impossible-by-correct-branch* on the hottest
customer-delivery path; **B2 makes it impossible-by-construction** (no `Dispatch`
reachability at all) for the cost of one table + one lock key. PR2/ADR-061
already refused `webhook_outbox` for this exact fan-out reason — B2 is consistent
with that precedent.

Decided **against**:

- **Temporal / DBOS (durable execution).** Its enqueue is an **RPC to a separate
  datastore**, so it is NOT in our Postgres transaction → reintroduces the exact
  dual-write the queue eliminates. It is also a stateful cluster (or SaaS that
  breaks the self-host wedge) solving a **bigger problem** — long-running,
  multi-step, stateful *workflows* — than we have (single-step idempotent jobs).
- **River (Go/Postgres) — for now.** Right shape, but its transactional
  `InsertTx` takes a **pgx-native `pgx.Tx`**; we are on `database/sql`, so its
  headline in-tx-enqueue property would not compose with our coordinator
  `*sql.Tx` without migrating the whole data layer. Buying the library and
  losing its one advantage is the worst of both.
- **`database/sql` → pgx-native migration, now.** Evaluated explicitly because it
  is the gate to River. We already use pgx as the *driver*; pgx-**native** would
  add binary-protocol perf, rich types, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, and `COPY` — but our
  workload exercises **none** of them today (transactional billing CRUD at
  moderate QPS; money is `int64` cents; JSONB is already hand-marshalled). The
  one real future fit is **`COPY` for high-volume usage-event ingestion** (the
  AI-native metering wedge). "Do it now while the codebase is small" does not win
  because (a) the **risk is size-independent** — it touches the RLS security
  boundary and every money query, where subtle type/NULL/query-mode differences
  hide money bugs and RLS leaks; (b) **zero payoff today** at pre-launch; and
  (c) the migration is **incremental and path-local** — pgx-native and
  `database/sql` coexist in one binary (two pools, same Postgres), so the future
  cost is "add a pgx pool on the ingestion path," not a big-bang refactor. So the
  "it only gets bigger later" premise does not hold.

## Status: build deferred

The **design** is decided; the **build** is not scheduled. Reasons: at low/mid
scale (0 customers, 1 dev) the four bespoke sweeps are **correct** and the
consolidation is **mostly** a *maintainability* win — adopting any queue does not
make money more correct on 5 of 6 sweeps (exactly-once effects = at-least-once
delivery + idempotent consumers + reconciliation, which the sweeps already are).
Per `feedback_pre_launch_scoping` / `feedback_no_overengineering`, a generic
async backbone is a solution to a problem (many heterogeneous effects + an ops
team) we do not have yet.

**ONE correctness exception, named honestly** (current-vs-queue panel, verified
in `creditnote/postgres.go`): `RetryPendingCreditNoteTaxReversal` carries a
second, structural eligibility branch — an issued CN with no reversal stamped
against a tax-bearing source, bounded to 24h — that exists ONLY to catch the
compound failure where `ReverseTax` *and* the `tax_reversal_pending` marker write
both fail in the same `Issue()`, an otherwise-invisible **permanent silent tax
over-remit** whose 24h window can age the orphan out for good. Enqueue-in-tx
(B2) deletes that failure mode and its window outright, because the obligation
commits atomically with the state change — there is no "did the marker write
land" question. This is real money-correctness, not maintainability — but it is
true for exactly **one of the four** migratable sweeps (`tax_commit`/`tax_reversal`
derive from pure durable state with TTL-encoding windows no queue can delete;
`clawback_issue` is safe-by-construction), and it is a low-probability, isolatable
failure. So it does **not** justify the backbone today — and if that orphan ever
bites, the cheap hedge is to make `cn_tax_reversal` alone enqueue-in-tx, not to
build the whole queue. The deferral stands; the "zero correctness on the table"
framing does not.

**Triggers to build the obligation queue:** a durable async obligation that is
NOT webhook-notification-shaped AND for which a targeted reconciler is
insufficient (e.g. it needs multi-step ordering / cross-effect dependency a flat
sweep can't model); OR the `cn_tax_reversal` orphan above actually bites in
production, OR a *second* sweep grows its own structural-orphan + bounded-window
backstop (the duplication has become a correctness pattern); OR the count of
**obligation-shaped** effects outgrows "one drainer + a few bespoke sweeps"
(rule of thumb ~6–7 — count MIGRATABLE effects only: Stripe state-syncs like
`payment_unknown` and settlement/payout reconciliation never enqueue, so the
migratable set is **4 today, not 6**); OR a `cmd/velox-worker` process split; OR
a second engineer joins (copy-paste a 1-dev shop tolerates, a 2-dev shop
shouldn't).

**Triggers to revisit pgx-native (and then River):** usage-event ingestion
becomes a *measured* bottleneck → stand up a pgx-native pool on **just the
ingestion path**, prove the `COPY` gain against a target, expand only if
justified. River falls out for free on whatever ends up pgx-native — the clean
way to arrive, not a speculative rewrite.

## Consequences

- We keep four small, proven, individually-correct sweeps for now; the
  duplication is real but bounded and not yet painful.
- The CN-tax-reversal recovery (PR2) deliberately did **not** route onto
  `webhook_outbox` (the fan-out leak) and used a per-CN marker + structural
  sweep instead — that decision stands until this queue exists.
- ADR-061's "committed PR3" wording is clarified: the *design* is committed
  (this ADR), the *build* is trigger-gated.

## Amendment (2026-06-25): the sweep driver shipped as the thin log/metric envelope

A pre-build design panel (asked to design a uniform reconciler *framework* as the
foundation for this queue) reached a sharper conclusion: a generic
`Source[T]`/`Drive[T]` framework would be a foundation for the *rejected* (c) —
its "swap a scan Source for a queue Source" extension assumes a new obligation
table + per-effect Source seam, which is the new-table/River shape this ADR ruled
out. The decided (c) instead **enqueues** obligations onto the generalised
`webhook_outbox` and drains them with **one** kind-dispatching drainer, collapsing
the per-effect scans — so a per-effect Source seam would be discarded when (c)
lands. We therefore shipped only the **thin sweep driver**: a single-method
`billing.Reconciler{ Name(); Reconcile(ctx, batch) (int, []error) }` + a ~25-line
ordered driver (`runReconcilers` / `s.reconcilers()`) that owns nil-skip, uniform
logging, and ONE new per-reconciler metric (`velox_reconciler_sweeps_total{reconciler,mode,outcome}`
— previously only auto-charge was metered). The six recovery sweeps
(payment_unknown, tax_retry, tax_commit, tax_reversal, clawback_issue,
cn_tax_reversal) ride it; their re-drive bodies and eligibility SQL are unchanged.

This **is** the foundation-seam for (c), aimed correctly: when the four re-drive
sweeps migrate onto the obligation queue (one at a time — enqueue in the
coordinator tx, register a kind-dispatch handler reusing the same re-drive body,
delete the bespoke `ListPendingX`), the outbox drainer slots in as **one more
`Reconciler`** in the same ordered slice — driver, leader gate, mode fan-out,
logging, and metric reused verbatim, **zero rewrite**. `payment_unknown` (a
Stripe state-sync) rides the metric envelope but never migrates to (c). No
generics, no `Source/Drive` split, and deliberately **no `Mark` hook** — marking
stays the last line of each re-drive body, so the PR2 marker-gating anti-pattern
has nowhere to recur. Shipped as a behaviour-preserving, net-negative-LOC PR; no
migration, no new table.
