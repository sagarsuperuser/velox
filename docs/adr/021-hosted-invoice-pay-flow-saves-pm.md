# ADR-021: Hosted-invoice Pay flow saves the card to the customer's Stripe customer

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-05-03

## Context

The hosted invoice page (Stripe-equivalent `hosted_invoice_url`) has a
Pay button that opens a Stripe Checkout session for the outstanding
balance. The end customer can tick "save card for future payments"
during that Checkout flow.

Operator-reported bug: customer paid an invoice via the hosted page,
ticked the save-card box, the payment succeeded — but the customer's
detail page in Velox kept showing "no payment method on file" and
later invoices fell into dunning instead of auto-charging.

Root cause was in `internal/api/adapters.go::CreateInvoicePaymentSession`.
The Checkout session was created in `mode=payment` with:

- **no `Customer`** — guest checkout, no Stripe customer object to
  attach the PM to.
- **no `setup_future_usage`** — the PM is consumed by the one-shot
  PaymentIntent and detached.

Even though the customer ticked "save," Stripe had no customer record
to attach the PM to and no instruction to keep it. The PM existed
transiently for the charge and then evaporated. `handleCheckoutCompleted`
correctly skipped the `customer_payment_setups` upsert (the
[ADR-020 follow-up fix from 2026-05-04](./020-invoice-timeline-coalesce-and-card-detail.md)
makes the upsert conditional on `FetchCardDetails` finding a PM
attached to the Stripe customer — which there was none to find).

The `/update-payment` flow from a no-PM email already does this
correctly — `mode=setup` with `Customer: stripeCustomerID`. The Pay
flow was the outlier.

## Decision

Pay-flow Checkout sessions now pass:

1. `Customer: stripeCustomerID` — resolved (or lazily minted) via
   `paymentmethods.StripeAdapter.EnsureStripeCustomer`. This is the
   same helper the customer portal already uses, so the portal-created
   customer and the Pay-flow customer share the same Stripe customer
   record.
2. `PaymentIntentData.SetupFutureUsage: "off_session"` — the canonical
   Stripe pattern from
   [Save card during payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment).
   The `off_session` value (vs. `on_session`) means Velox can charge
   this card later without the customer present, which is what dunning
   auto-retry needs.

`hostedInvoiceStripeAdapter` gains a one-method `stripeCustomerEnsurer`
interface dependency rather than importing `paymentmethods` directly,
keeping `internal/api/adapters.go` from depending on a peer package
beyond the wiring layer. `paymentmethods.StripeAdapter` satisfies it.

Wiring order in `router.go` shifted: `paymentMethodsStripe` is now
constructed earlier (next to the hosted-invoice adapter wiring) so it
can be passed into both the hosted-invoice adapter AND the
customer-portal payment-methods service later.

## Consequences

**Save-card on Pay actually saves the card.** When the end customer
ticks the box (or with `off_session`, it's saved unconditionally —
Stripe shows "Cardholder authorizes future charges" disclosure copy
instead of an opt-in checkbox), the PM is attached to the Stripe
customer and:

- `checkout.session.completed` webhook → `handleCheckoutCompleted`
  finds the attached PM via `FetchCardDetails(stripeCustomerID)`,
  upserts `customer_payment_setups` with `setup_status='ready'` +
  card brand + last 4.
- `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook → invoice marked paid + card
  details stamped on the invoice via `SetPaymentCard` (ADR-020).
- Future invoices auto-charge via the existing dunning path (no
  email/Update-Payment-Method round-trip needed).

**A Stripe customer is minted on first hosted-invoice payment** for
any Velox customer that doesn't already have one. The current
`EnsureStripeCustomer` mints a bare customer (only `metadata`, no
`email`/`name`). A separate cleanup should pass through the Velox
customer's email + display name so the Stripe dashboard shows useful
identity — tracked as a follow-up, not blocking on this fix because
the bare customer is functionally correct (PM attaches, charges work,
webhook routing works).

**`off_session` is mandatory, not opt-in.** Per Stripe Checkout
semantics, `setup_future_usage='off_session'` tells the customer
their card will be saved for future charges; there is no checkbox.
Operators who want an opt-in UX would need `on_session` (saved only
if customer ticks) — but `on_session` cannot drive off-session dunning
charges, so it's the wrong primitive for an invoice-driven product.
Stripe's own Billing product uses `off_session` for the same reason.

## Alternatives considered

- **Switch to `mode=setup` + separate charge.** The /update-payment
  flow uses this. It works but adds a second roundtrip and a
  reconciler for the case where setup succeeds and charge fails —
  net more code, not less. `mode=payment` with
  `setup_future_usage` is the Stripe-recommended one-step flow for
  this scenario.
- **Always create the Stripe customer at Velox-customer-creation
  time.** Cleaner data model, but every Velox customer would have a
  Stripe customer record even if they're never charged via Stripe
  (offline invoicing, manual reconciliation, etc.). Lazy mint on first
  Stripe-bound action keeps dormant tenants from polluting the
  operator's Stripe dashboard.
