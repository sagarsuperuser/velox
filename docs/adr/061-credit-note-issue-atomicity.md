# ADR-061: Credit-note `Issue()` atomicity (atomic internal effects + transactional-outbox external effects)

## Status

**Built — PR2 (2026-06-25).** See the **Amendment (2026-06-25)** at the end of
this ADR, which records where the implementation diverged from this blueprint.
Original status: Accepted (design-only) — 2026-06-24, build deferred to a named
trigger. The course changed (the user prioritised the end-to-end long-term fix
over deferral) and it shipped.

## Context

The liveness audit (2026-06-23) found a sink in `creditnote.Service.Issue()`:
the `draft→issued` compare-and-swap (CAS) commits in its **own**
transaction, and the side effects run **afterward** in separate calls. If a
side effect fails, the credit note is durably `issued` while its effect
never happened — most visibly, an `issued` credit-channel note whose
`GrantForCreditNote` failed leaves the customer **shown a credit they never
received**, with no automatic recovery (re-Issue refused: `status!=draft`;
Void refused: issued is final).

The first instinct was a reconciler that re-runs the missing grant. The
project principle (see `feedback_first_good_practice_default`) corrects
that: **go for the first good practice by default; the second practice
needs a really strong reason.** A reconciler is the *second* practice; it
over-applies eventual-consistency to a side effect that could simply be
atomic.

`Issue()` does three kinds of work, and the right tool differs by kind:

1. **State transition** — `draft→issued` (the CAS). Internal.
2. **Internal side effects** — `GrantForCreditNote` (credit ledger) for a
   paid invoice's credit note, or `ApplyCreditNote` (reduce `amount_due`)
   for an unpaid invoice. Both are DB writes on the same pool.
3. **External side effects** — the Stripe refund (refund-channel note) and
   the **tax reversal** at the provider. Network calls; they cannot share a
   DB transaction.

Today (1) is its own transaction and (2) and (3) are separate, unguarded
calls afterward — a classic dual-write.

## Decision

Make `Issue()` first-practice end-to-end, by kind of effect.

### Internal effects → one transaction (atomic)

The CAS and the internal side effect commit together in a **coordinator
`*sql.Tx`** threaded through the creditnote, credit, and invoice stores —
the ADR-056 pattern Velox already uses for proration. The CAS provides both
concurrency safety (exactly one caller proceeds) **and** atomicity: a grant
or `amount_due` failure rolls the issue back, the note stays `draft`, and
the caller retries cleanly. The issued-but-ungranted orphan **cannot
exist** — there is nothing to reconcile.

Shape:

- New tx-accepting store variants: `creditnote.TransitionStatusTx`,
  `credit.GrantForCreditNoteTx`, `invoice.ApplyCreditNoteTx` — each
  operating on a passed `*sql.Tx`.
- `Issue()` opens the coordinator tx (RLS: `BeginTx(ctx, TxTenant,
  tenantID)`), performs CAS + the internal effect on that tx, and commits.

### External effects → transactional outbox (first-practice for a network boundary)

The Stripe refund and tax reversal **cannot** be in the DB transaction —
that is the genuine strong reason, and it is the *only* place the second
tier is justified here. But the first practice for a network boundary is
**not** fire-and-forget + an after-the-fact reconciler scan; it is the
**transactional outbox** (ADR-040): enqueue the *obligation*
("reverse tax for invoice X", "refund PaymentIntent Y") **inside the
coordinator tx**, so the intent commits atomically with the issue and
**cannot be lost**. A dispatcher then executes it with Stripe idempotency
keys; a backstop sweep handles dead-letter rows.

So: the obligation is atomic; only its execution is asynchronous.

### Reconciler → backstop only

A reconciler/marker-scan survives in exactly one role: the dead-letter
sweep for stuck outbox rows. It is never the primary mechanism for a
correctness-bearing effect.

### Net invariant

After this change, for any committed `issued` credit note: its internal
effect is committed (atomic), and its external obligations are durably
enqueued (outbox). Neither an ungranted orphan nor a lost tax-reversal can
occur. The 0093 credit-ledger dedup index and Stripe idempotency keys
become belts, not the mechanism.

## Consequences

- One coherent flow, no special-case recovery paths for the internal grant.
- The external effects move from inline to enqueue-in-tx + async dispatch —
  a sequencing change that must preserve correctness (do not reverse tax or
  refund before the issue is durably committed; the outbox enqueue is what
  guarantees the ordering).
- Moderate refactor: three tx-variant store methods + the coordinator in
  `Issue()` + moving two external effects onto the outbox. The patterns
  (ADR-056 coordinator, ADR-040 outbox) already exist; this is composition,
  not invention.
- Tests: atomic-rollback (grant fails → note stays `draft`, no ledger
  entry); obligation-durability (Stripe down at issue → outbox row present,
  dispatched later, exactly once); no double-grant under concurrent Issue.

## Alternatives considered

- **Reconciler-first (re-run the grant via the 0093 dedup index).**
  Rejected as the *primary* — it is the second practice applied to an
  internal effect that can be atomic; it leaves a window and needs a
  scan/marker. Retained only as the deferred-build fallback if the atomic
  refactor itself is postponed.
- **A persisted `grant_settled` / `issue_pending` marker column to bound a
  reconciler scan.** Rejected — solves a scale problem we don't have and
  cements the second practice with a migration.
- **Outbox for the *internal* effects too.** Rejected — overkill; an
  in-process DB write belongs in the transaction, not on an async queue.
- **Do nothing.** The current state is the deferred gap; acceptable only
  because it is pre-launch with no victim (see Scope).

## Scope and sequencing

**Deferred build**, trigger = the first design partner issuing
account-credit credit notes (the feature carries real money). When built,
do it as **one pass covering the whole flow**, not piecemeal — and **fold
in the sibling gap**: `reverseInvoiceTax` can also fail post-issue today
(an external effect), which wants the identical outbox treatment. So the
unit of work is: internal effects (grant, `amount_due`) atomic in the
coordinator tx **+** external effects (tax reversal, refund) on the
transactional outbox — grant + reduce + reverse + refund, together.

Until then, a grant failure here is an operator-visible error plus a manual
fix; the marker comment at the grant site records this.

  table needs no cross-peer import), so the clawback path may warrant the
  same outbox treatment for consistency. Tracked by the product-wide
  first-vs-second-practice audit (2026-06-24).

## Amendment (2026-06-25): Built in PR2

`creditnote.Service.Issue()` now runs the `draft→issued` CAS and the **internal**
money effect — `amount_due` reduction (unpaid) or credit grant (paid) — on one
coordinator `*sql.Tx` (ADR-056), committing them together. The **external**
effects (Stripe refund, upstream tax reversal) run post-commit, idempotency-keyed
and recoverable. The implementation diverges from the blueprint above in four
recorded ways (per `feedback_amend_decisions_when_course_changes`):

1. **Coordinator-tx is the mechanism; NO source-dedup table.** `ApplyCreditNote`
   and `GrantForCreditNote` each have exactly **one** caller (`Issue()`), gated by
   the CAS, so the reduction/grant is idempotent **by construction** — a crash
   mid-tx rolls both back (note stays `draft`, reconciler re-drives cleanly); a
   crash post-commit leaves `status='issued'`, so a re-entry loses the CAS
   (`won=false`) and never re-applies. The blueprint's `(tenant, source)` dedup row
   is therefore dead weight today and would be belt-and-suspenders
   (`feedback_no_belt_and_suspenders`); it is recorded as the **first brick of the
   deferred `amount_due`-derived-ledger** (north star below). A code comment at
   each apply/grant site pins the single-CAS-gated-caller invariant — a reviewer
   adding a second caller MUST reintroduce the dedup.

2. **CN tax reversal: post-commit + durable marker + CN-scoped sweep — NOT on
   `webhook_outbox`.** The blueprint said "tax reversal on the transactional
   outbox." That outbox (ADR-040) is a **customer-notification fan-out**
   (`dispatcher → svc.Dispatch → matchesEvent` against `'*'`/prefix
   subscriptions), so an `internal.*` obligation row would **leak to customer
   endpoints**. Instead PR2 keeps the reversal post-commit with its existing per-CN
   `velox_tax_rev_<cn.ID>` key and makes it recoverable: a durable
   `credit_notes.tax_reversal_pending` marker (migration 0123), a CN-scoped
   scheduler sweep (`RetryPendingCreditNoteTaxReversal`) that re-drives with the
   same key, and the inline failure raised `WARN→ERROR`. The sweep's eligibility
   is **derived from durable structural state** (an issued CN with no reversal
   stamped against a tax-bearing `stripe_tax` source), with the marker as a
   fast-path index — **not** the sole key — so a compound failure (reversal *and*
   marker write both fail) is still recovered, mirroring #310 whose eligibility is
   the default persisted state (caught by the pre-merge review). This closes a
   **reachable live over-remit**: `#310 RetryPendingTaxReversal` scans only
   voided/uncollectible invoices and keys off `invoices.tax_reversed_at`, so a CN
   reversal stamped on a finalized/paid invoice is structurally invisible to it.
   The outbox-obligation route is the **north star**, un-deferred at the first live
   tax design partner (when a dispatcher event-type discriminator + obligation
   handler-registry is justified).

3. **Reconciliation is first-class.** Reconciliation against processor truth is
   mandatory even with an idempotent external API (chargebacks, async settlement
   the queue can never see). The "second practice" caution applies only to a
   reconciler used as the *primary* mechanism for an effect that **could** be made
   atomic — not to processor-truth reconciliation, nor to the CN tax-reversal sweep
   above (whose effect is genuinely external and cannot share the DB tx).

4. **Async backbone — DESIGN decided (ADR-062), BUILD deferred.** The four
   bespoke re-drive sweeps (tax-commit #267, tax-reversal #310, clawback-issue
   ADR-057, PR2's CN-tax-reversal) will eventually consolidate onto ONE durable
   obligation queue, built by **generalising the existing `webhook_outbox`** (it
   already has in-tx `Enqueue(ctx, tx, …)`, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, DLQ,
   advisory-lock leader) with an internal/external discriminator. Decided AGAINST
   Temporal (its enqueue is an RPC to a separate datastore → reintroduces the
   dual-write; a cluster/SaaS breaks the self-host wedge; workflows are the wrong
   abstraction for single-step idempotent jobs) and AGAINST River-for-now (its
   `InsertTx` needs a pgx-native `pgx.Tx`; Velox is on `database/sql`, so its in-tx
   enqueue wouldn't compose with our coordinator `*sql.Tx` without migrating the
   whole data layer — 60 files / 385 query sites / the RLS core). At low/mid scale
   the four sweeps are correct and the consolidation is a *maintainability* win,
   not a correctness need, so the **build is trigger-gated** (≥~6 async effects, a
   non-notification obligation a reconciler can't cover, or a worker-process
   split). Full build-vs-buy + pgx-now-vs-later rationale and triggers in ADR-062.

### North stars / do-not-build (recorded, with triggers)

- **Generic durable obligation queue** (PR3 above) — trigger: a durable async
  obligation that is not webhook-notification-shaped, or a `cmd/velox-worker`
  process split (ADR-040 anticipates it).
- **`amount_due` as a derived ledger** (+ its `(tenant, source)` dedup first
  brick) — trigger: a **second** independent `amount_due` mutator (e.g.
  out-of-band partial payments racing a credit note), at which point the
  single-CAS-gated-caller invariant no longer covers all writers.
- **`EventDispatcher.Dispatch` `*sql.Tx` threading** across the ~8 fire-and-forget
  webhook emitters — trigger: first observed lost-event incident, or a design
  partner reconciling off webhook delivery. A notification seam (a lost event
  self-heals via subscriber re-poll), not a money-state seam.

### What shipped

Migration 0123 (`credit_notes.tax_reversal_pending` + partial index); tx-variant
store methods (`TransitionStatusTx`, `UpdateAllocationTx`, `ApplyCreditNoteTx`,
`GrantForCreditNoteTx`, `creditnote` `BeginTx`); the `Issue()` coordinator-tx
rewrite (both paid and unpaid branches); `RetryPendingCreditNoteTaxReversal` +
its scheduler tick; the `WARN→ERROR` raise; deletion of the now-false
"manual reconcile" comment in `engine.IssueCancelDrafts`. Tests: a real-Postgres
grant-failure-rolls-back-the-CAS proof, an in-memory failed-reversal-marks-pending
+ sweep-recovers proof, and the existing CAS-idempotency suite (unchanged, still
green). No new reconciler key beyond the marker; reuses ADR-056/057 primitives.
