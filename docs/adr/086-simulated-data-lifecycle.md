# ADR-086: Simulated-data lifecycle — durable `is_simulated` sweep-gates + clock-delete teardown

**Status:** Accepted 2026-07-09; **revised 2026-07-09** after the design-B pivot — this file replaces the original "immutable `sim_clock_id` discriminator on every sim-bearing table" plan (see *Alternatives considered — why not a durable discriminator on every table*).
**Supersedes:** ADR-016 (test-clock soft-delete + cancel-subs + detach-customers → **complete hard-delete teardown**).
**Extends:** ADR-029 (fully-disjoint test-clock flows).
**Reaffirms:** ADR-030 (simulated time on clock-pinned entities stays; `created_at` is domain time) **and its audit exception** (the audit log is always wall-clock).

## Context

In **test mode** (`livemode=false`) two time domains share one dataset: **wall-clock** (real-test data + every cron sweep on `time.Now()`) and **simulated** (test-clock-pinned entities whose billing timestamps are stamped at the clock's `frozen_time`). An adversarial audit found **24 defects** where a wall-clock plane (auto-charge, dunning, tax, credit-expiry, usage-billing, analytics, ~8 FE surfaces) processes a *simulated* record against wall-clock time. All are test-mode-only (no live-money impact), but they violate ADR-029, corrupt demos/QA, and lie in the UI.

The 24 split into **two independent problems**:

1. **Live-clock leak.** While a clock is alive, a simulated invoice stamped at `frozen_time` can look "due"/"overdue" to a wall-clock sweep *right now* and get auto-charged or dunned — even though nothing was deleted. ADR-029 requires wall-clock sweeps to skip simulated rows.
2. **Deleted-clock leak.** The old model (ADR-016) *soft*-deleted the clock and detached its customers (`test_clock_id → NULL`), leaving the simulated rows behind with their pin nulled. The "skip me, I'm simulated" pin vanished and every wall-clock plane grabbed the orphans. The pin-join also missed customer-pinned **one-off** invoices (no subscription to join through).

## Decision

Two targeted mechanisms, one per problem — **no new per-row discriminator, no write-chokepoint** (see *Alternatives considered*).

### 1. Live-clock half — money sweeps gate on the durable `is_simulated` (shipped #417/#420)

Every wall-clock money sweep is **invoice-anchored** (auto-charge `ListAutoChargePending`; dunning `ListDueRuns` / `ListFailedWithoutDunningRun`; tax `ListPendingTaxRetry` / `ListPendingTaxCommit`). `invoices` already carries a durable `is_simulated` flag (migration 0109, stamped once at write from `customerOnTestClock`); `credit_notes` too (0117). The sweeps now filter `AND i.is_simulated = false` instead of the old mutable pin-join. Because `is_simulated` is stamped at creation and never mutates, detaching or deleting the clock can't flip an existing invoice back into a wall-clock sweep. This closes the money-critical live-clock leaks with **zero schema change** — the flag was already there.

### 2. Deleted-clock half — clock delete = **complete teardown** (this ADR's change)

Deleting a test clock **hard-deletes the clock and tears down its entire simulated customer graph** in one `TxTenant` transaction (`internal/testclock.Delete`): every customer pinned to the clock (`customers.test_clock_id = $clock`) and every row those customers own — invoices with their line-item / dunning / tax children, credit notes, subscriptions (+ items / changes / thresholds via CASCADE), usage events, the credit ledger, per-customer config, and portal rows — deleted **bottom-up** so migration-0015's `RESTRICT` guards never trip, and the customers **last** (before the clock) so `customers.test_clock_id`'s `ON DELETE SET NULL` fires on nothing. After it runs **no simulated row survives**, so *no* wall-clock plane — money or not, invoice-anchored or not — can ever act on a stranded simulated row. The deleted-clock class is dissolved wholesale, not sweep-by-sweep.

This is the Stripe test-clock model: the customer is born into the sandbox and is discarded with it. History is not lost — the clock deletion is recorded in the audit log (wall-clock, ADR-030 exception). The old soft-delete + cancel-subs + detach dance (ADR-016) is gone, and with it the `test_clocks.deleted_at` column, its partial index, and the 8 now-vestigial `deleted_at IS NULL` read filters (migration 0144). Phantom-MRR from `canceled_at = NULL` subs dissolves because the subs are *deleted*, not canceled.

### 3. Anti-regression — a mechanized **completeness** guard (two layers)

Teardown is only safe if it is *complete*: a simulated table left out of the delete set silently re-opens the deleted-clock leak. Two arch-tests make completeness un-forgettable, discovering the live schema from `information_schema` / `pg_constraint` (no hand-maintained list):

- **Layer A — customer-scope completeness** (`TestTeardownCoversEverySimulatedTable`). Every table with a `customer_id` column must be either in the teardown delete set or in an explicit `teardownKeepAllowlist` with a written reason. A new customer-owned table added later fails CI until it is classified. This is the guard that caught the two real gaps found while building: `customer_discounts` missing from the delete set, and `customer_payment_setups` (a table that had been dropped from the schema).
- **Layer B — FK-closure integrity** (`TestTeardownLeavesNoDanglingReference`). For every foreign key whose *parent* rows the teardown deletes, the *child* rows must be deleted too — otherwise the teardown aborts (RESTRICT / NO ACTION child) or leaks a nulled reference (SET NULL — the exact original bug shape, `customers.test_clock_id`). CASCADE children are folded into the deleted set first; any non-cascade FK into that closure whose child sits outside it fails, with no seed data required.

A real-Postgres integration test (`TestDelete_TearsDownSimulatedGraph_KeepsEverythingElse`) exercises the actual ordered DELETEs and the pinned-vs-unpinned survivor discrimination; a mutation-verify confirms Layer B bites when a table is dropped from the set.

### 4. FE relative-time surfaces — a required-anchor helper (this change)

The **~8 frontend surfaces** in the audit (Context) render values *relative to "now"* — "X ago", "in N days", cycle %, rolling usage windows, due/expiry badges. On a clock-pinned entity "now" is the clock's `frozen_time`, not wall-clock; the earlier #410/#411/#413 sweep fixed the *instances* by threading an optional `nowISO`, but every helper still ended in `?? Date.now()` — a **forgettable** fallback (a new surface that omits the anchor silently reverts to wall-clock, wrong only once a clock is advanced). That residual is the same shape as the sweep leaks: correctness by discipline, not by construction.

This change converts the discipline into a **mechanized gate** (`web-v2/src/lib/effectiveNow.ts`):

- A **branded `EffectiveNow`** type. The only ways to make one are `effectiveNow(frozenISO)` (entity surfaces — `frozen_time` when pinned, wall time when not) and `wallClockNow()` (an *explicit, greppable* wall-clock opt-in for the forensic/egress layer — audit log, email/webhook outbox, reaffirming ADR-030 — and never-pinned entities like API keys / webhook endpoints). Every relative-time helper **requires** an `EffectiveNow`, with **no `?? Date.now()` anywhere** — so "did you handle the test clock?" becomes a **compile error**, not a runtime bug. This is the stronger, enumerable guarantee, the same principle the teardown chose over the discriminator.
- A **second, independent** gate: an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule bans raw `Date.now()` / argless `new Date()` in app code, so a *hand-rolled* relative-time computation can't bypass the helpers. Genuine calendar/infra uses opt out with a one-line reason; the date-infra modules (`lib/dates.ts`, the date-picker) are exempted.
- The gate immediately caught **two real latent bugs the instance-sweep missed** — both *input validation*, not display: a clock-pinned customer's **credit-expiry** date validation (the CustomerDetail invoice composer and the Credits grant dialog) checked "must be a future date" against wall-clock, so a customer frozen in 2027 would wrongly accept a 2026 (sim-past) expiry. Both now anchor on the customer's effective-now.

The helper sits over the existing client-side frozen-time resolution (`useClockFrozenMap`); if the backend later ships `effective_now` per row (the `InvoiceDunningRun.effective_now` pattern is the template), `effectiveNow()` takes that value with **no call-site change**. A pure-logic drift-guard (`web-v2/tests/effectiveNow.test.ts`, `npm test`, no new runner) proves each helper measures against the anchor — a frozen-2027 assertion a leaked `Date.now()` would fail.

## Alternatives considered — why not a durable discriminator on every table

The first design (a full day of panels) proposed the *comprehensive* fix: add an immutable `sim_clock_id` birth-stamp to **every** sim-bearing table, derive `is_simulated` as a `GENERATED` column from it, funnel all sim-capable writes through a `WithSimulation(clockID)` chokepoint, `ON DELETE CASCADE` the stamp, and add a sweep-filter arch-test asserting every sweep carries an `is_simulated` predicate. It would have worked. It was rejected because it is **containment machinery for a problem teardown deletes outright**:

- It adds a column + generated column + `CHECK` + partial index to ~7 tables, a write-chokepoint that every creation door must route through (including the LiteLLM ingest door — the #406 lint-scope lesson), and a sweep arch-test whose core predicate — *"is this `SELECT` a wall-clock sweep?"* — **isn't decidable**, so it ships as an allowlist-backed gate, not an airtight one. That is the complexity-accretion smell: each guard spawns the next.
- Its entire payoff over teardown is *keeping* simulated rows readable after a clock is deleted. At **zero customers, pre-launch**, discarding a deleted sandbox's data is a non-cost — it is exactly what Stripe test clocks do.
- Teardown's completeness is **enumerable** (Layer A/B walk the schema and fail closed); the discriminator's sweep-safety is **not** (the undecidable predicate). The smaller design carries the *stronger* guarantee.

The live-clock half still needs a durable flag — but only on the **money sweeps**, which are all invoice-anchored, and `invoices.is_simulated` already exists. So the discriminator's one genuinely-needed piece was already in the schema; the rest was apparatus to avoid deleting test data.

## Known limitations & deferred (each with a trigger)

- **Non-money live-clock gates** — credit-expiry (`ListExpiredGrants`), usage-aggregation, and analytics counts over non-invoice tables are **deferred**, not built via a discriminator: they are test-mode-only, carry no live-money impact, and are narrow (the wall-clock billing scheduler already excludes clock-pinned subs, ADR-028). Trigger: an operator hits one in a real simulation.
- **No `created_at` time-split** — `created_at` / `updated_at` stay simulated (`clock.Now`) on clock-pinned entities, reaffirming ADR-030; the wall-clock forensic layer is the audit log (`sim_effective_at` metadata carries the simulated instant). Trigger: a compliance/debugging need beyond the audit log.
- **Pricing `GetRuleByKeyAsOf`** compares a rule's wall-clock `created_at` against a sim `asOf` (`pricing/postgres.go`). Correct for forward-advanced clocks and single-version rules (≈all usage) and it never errors (fallback to the earliest active version). Trigger: an operator hits it with a behind-anchored clock on a multi-version rule.
- **Post-teardown forensic grouping** — once the rows are gone, "which clock produced this" is unanswerable; acceptable by design. Trigger: a named audit need → capture a summary audit row at teardown before the delete.
