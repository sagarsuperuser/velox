# ADR-035: Per-fact simulated-time anchoring under test-clock catchup

**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

ADR-029 (fully disjoint test-clock flows) gave clock-pinned subscriptions
their own catchup orchestrator: every time-driven engine concern (cycle
billing, threshold scan, tax retry, auto-charge, credit expiry, dunning
advance, reminders) runs in dependency order inside one Advance click.
ADR-030 added a clock resolver so per-invoice timestamp writes
(`next_action_at`, `last_attempt_at`, `resolved_at`, `created_at`) land
in the simulated-time domain instead of wall-clock.

A multi-week dogfood pass in May 2026 surfaced a deeper structural gap:
even with the resolver wired, time-driven engine writes stamped the
**orchestrator's current frozen_time** (= advance-end), not the
**per-fact simulated instant** the engine concern actually represented.

Concrete symptoms reported against the dashboard / invoice timeline /
mailpit:

- An Apr → Jul-21 advance billing the May 1 cycle stamped that
  invoice's `IssuedAt` / `CreatedAt` / `DueAt` at `2024-07-21`, not
  `2024-05-01`. The invoice activity timeline read "Invoice
  created Jul 21" for a cycle whose period boundary was May 1.
- Dunning runs created during catchup had `next_action_at = frozen_time
  + grace_period`. So a May 1 invoice failing during a May 20 advance
  scheduled retry #1 for May 23 — past frozen_time — and zero retries
  fired in the same Advance.
- Inside the dunning state machine's retry loop, each retry's
  `last_attempt_at` and the next scheduled `next_action_at` were
  anchored on `clock.Now(ctx)` (= frozen_time, constant for the whole
  pass), so retry #N+1's `next_action_at` was always `frozen_time +
  interval` — past advance-end → never fires.
- Dunning event rows (`started`, `retry_attempted` x N, `escalated`)
  all stamped `clock.Now(ctx)` at write time. Operator saw 4 rows at
  one timestamp instead of the per-fact chronology.
- Credit ledger entries created during catchup (cancel-proration
  grants, expiry, applied-to-invoice usage) stacked at advance-end on
  the customer's Credits tab.
- `Phase 5` (dunning) fired only once per Advance — even when multiple
  retries were due in the simulated window, only the first fired,
  because `processRun` left the next `next_action_at` past `frozen_time`
  and `ProcessDueRunsForClock` did not re-query.

These were not separate bugs; they were one architectural pattern
applied uniformly across the engine: **`clock.Now(ctx)` returns
advance-end frozen_time during catchup, and was used as the per-fact
timestamp for events that actually occurred at distinct earlier
simulated instants.**

## Decision

Every per-fact write under test-clock catchup stamps the **simulated
instant the fact occurred**, not the orchestrator's current frozen_time.
Implemented as a cascade of explicit-parameter handoffs from outermost
phase to innermost write:

### 1. Cycle billing anchors on `sub.NextBillingAt`

`engine.billOnePeriod` resolves `now` from `*sub.NextBillingAt` (the
cycle's own close instant) rather than `effectiveNow(sub)` (= clock's
current value). Falls back to `effectiveNow` when `NextBillingAt` is
unset (unreachable from `billSubscription`'s caught-up check, kept
defensive).

`now` is then used uniformly for `IssuedAt` / `CreatedAt` / `DueAt`,
tax calculation date, pause-resume gate, trial-end activation,
`advanceCycleOrCancel` stamps, and `MarkPaid` for zero-amount
auto-paid invoices. In the cron (wall-clock) path `NextBillingAt`
≈ scheduler tick within minutes; change is neutral.

### 2. Dunning state machine carries simulated time explicitly

`dunning.Service.StartDunning(... failureAt time.Time)` — the caller
supplies the cycle-close instant. The Stripe-webhook caller and the
inline-failure caller in `ChargeInvoice` both derive `failureAt` via
the new `simulatedFailureAt(inv)` helper: latest invoice period
boundary at or before `IssuedAt` (which is `BillingPeriodEnd` for
in_arrears and `BillingPeriodStart` for in_advance — the cycle-close
moment in both directions).

`processRun` anchors each retry's effective-now on `run.NextActionAt`
(the moment the retry was scheduled for) rather than `clock.Now(ctx)`.
The chain advances forward in simulated time: retry #1 at `T + grace`,
retry #2 at `T + grace + retry_schedule[0]`, etc. — each fires at its
own scheduled instant rather than collapsing onto frozen_time.

`exhaustRun(... firedAt time.Time)` — caller passes the triggering
retry's instant so the escalated state's `resolved_at` and the
escalated event row align with the retry that caused the exhaustion.

### 3. Phase 5 loops until empty

`ProcessDueRunsForClock` re-queries `ListDueRunsForClock` after each
batch until it returns zero rows. Safety cap of 50 iterations; a
non-progressing-run guard breaks the loop if a transient-skip case
returns the same run without advancing `attempt_count`. With the
in-state-machine simulated-time chain (item 2), each retry's new
`next_action_at` lands at a simulated instant that may still be
≤ frozen_time, so the loop walks the full retry schedule in one
Advance.

### 4. Postgres stores honor caller-supplied `CreatedAt`

`dunning.PostgresStore.CreateEvent` and `credit.PostgresStore.AppendEntry`
respect a non-zero `CreatedAt` on the input struct, falling back to
`clock.Now(ctx)` only when unset. Wall-clock callers (operator-action
paths) continue to use the fallback. Service-layer callers in catchup
paths pass the per-fact instant: dunning_started at cycle close,
retry_attempted at the scheduled instant, escalated at the triggering
retry, credit grants at the action moment (cancel-proration at
`cancelAt`), expiries at `grant.ExpiresAt`.

### 5. `ApplyToInvoiceAtomic` takes an `at time.Time`

`credit.Service.ApplyToInvoiceAt(... at time.Time)` and a new
`engine.CreditApplier.ApplyToInvoiceAt` interface — engine
(billOnePeriod, threshold_scan) pass their `now` (= cycle close) so
the usage entry and invoice `updated_at` land on per-cycle simulated
time. Operator-path callers pass `time.Time{}` to opt out and fall
back to `clock.Now(ctx)`.

### 6. Inline `StartDunning` on definitive charge failure

Closes a Phase 3 → Phase 5 timing race: `ChargeInvoice` previously
deferred dunning-run creation to the `payment_intent.payment_failed`
webhook. On wall-clock fine — the cron's Phase 5 ticks every 5 min and
catches up. Under catchup the orchestrator runs Phase 3 → Phase 5
back-to-back; the webhook arrives async after Phase 5 has exited, so
the new run sits at `attempt_count=0` until the next Advance.

`ChargeInvoice`, when it gets a **definitively** failed PI error (not
the ambiguous unknown/timeout case — those still defer to the
reconciler), now inline-calls `StartDunning`. Safe alongside the
webhook path because `StartDunning` is idempotent by invoice (migration
0085 UNIQUE index on `invoice_dunning_runs.invoice_id`). The webhook
path becomes a redundant secondary trigger — better resilience for
wall-clock too (e.g. Stripe webhook outage).

### 7. One email per retry attempt

`payment_intent.payment_failed` webhook handler suppresses its generic
payment-failed email when the PI carries `velox_purpose=dunning_retry`
metadata. Dunning's `paymentRetrierAdapter` tags retry PIs via a
dedicated `Stripe.ChargeInvoiceForDunningRetry` method (typed,
explicit — not a ctx-threaded side channel, not a cross-domain
options import). End state per exhausted N-retry run: 1 initial-fail
email + (N-1) warning emails + 1 escalation = N+1 total. Stripe
Smart Retries / Lago parity.

## Why this design

**Explicit per-fact instants vs implicit ctx-clock.** ADR-030 made
`clock.Now(ctx)` resolve to frozen_time for clock-pinned contexts —
a useful single-clock abstraction, but `frozen_time` is constant
across a multi-period catchup pass. The simulated instant for
event N differs from event N+1. An implicit single value can't
represent "many simulated instants in one wall-clock pass."

Explicit parameter handoffs (`failureAt`, `firedAt`, `at`, `CreatedAt`
on the struct) carry the right per-fact instant from where the engine
knows it (e.g. `sub.NextBillingAt` at billing time, `run.NextActionAt`
at retry-fire time) down to the persistence layer.

**Honor-caller + fallback at the store boundary.** Postgres stores
respect a caller-supplied `CreatedAt` when set, fall back to
`clock.Now(ctx)` when zero. This keeps the operator-action path
(wall-clock, no specific instant to anchor on) cheap and the catchup
path correct without a global flag.

**Migration 0085's UNIQUE index is the keystone.** One dunning run per
invoice for lifetime means `StartDunning` can be called from anywhere
(inline charge-failure path, async webhook, manual operator action)
safely — duplicates return the existing run. This is what makes the
inline + webhook redundancy work without coordination.

**Phase 5 loop vs new orchestrator design.** Rather than restructure
catchup to interleave phases at simulated-time boundaries (e.g. fire
Phase 3 + 5 at each cycle-close in lockstep), Phase 5 loops until the
state machine drains. Cheaper to implement, less invasive, matches
the natural "queue of due work" shape.

## Alternatives considered

- **Single `now` parameter threaded through everything.** Rejected:
  each phase's `now` is different. Cycle billing's `now` is
  `sub.NextBillingAt`; dunning's per-retry `now` is
  `run.NextActionAt`. One parameter would have to carry a function,
  which is just ctx-threading with extra steps.
- **Variadic options on `ChargeInvoice`.** Considered for the
  retry-purpose tagging. Rejected: requires `payment.ChargeOption`
  type, and either (a) engine's `InvoiceCharger` interface imports
  `payment` (cross-domain import per CLAUDE.md), or (b) the engine
  loses static type safety. A dedicated typed method
  (`ChargeInvoiceForDunningRetry`) on the concrete `*Stripe` is
  narrower and more explicit.
- **Context-threading `velox_purpose`.** Initial implementation;
  reverted in favor of the typed method. Ctx-threading is the right
  pattern for cross-cutting concerns (tenant, livemode, deadline)
  but inappropriate for a narrow per-call configuration that lives
  at one boundary.
- **Restructure the orchestrator to interleave phases by simulated
  time.** Cleaner conceptually but a much larger change. Deferred —
  Phase 5 looping captures the only phase where intra-pass
  recursion actually matters (auto-charge is one-shot per invoice;
  tax retry is one-shot per code-class; credit expiry is one-shot
  per grant).

## Consequences

### Positive
- Invoice activity timeline reads per-fact chronology — no more "all
  events at advance-end."
- One Advance click walks the dunning state machine to completion
  (Stripe Test Clocks parity).
- Customer email cadence matches industry: 1 initial-failure + (N-1)
  warnings + 1 escalation per N-retry exhausted run.
- Pause-collection / trial-end / scheduled-change gates evaluate in
  simulated time per cycle, not at the orchestrator's advance-end.
- Wall-clock production path benefits from the inline `StartDunning`
  resilience: a Stripe webhook outage no longer blocks dunning-run
  creation.

### Risks / open items
- **No explicit invariant test** locking the Phase 3 → Phase 5
  invariant (Phase 5 sees the dunning run created by Phase 3 in the
  same Advance). If a future change reverts inline `StartDunning`
  back to webhook-only, the race returns. Followup work:
  integration test against real Postgres + mock Stripe charger.
- **Email outbox timestamps stay wall-clock** by design — the actual
  SMTP send happens in real time. Operator looking at Mailpit will
  see wall-clock send times next to simulated-time dunning rows.
  This is correct semantically but visually inconsistent.
- **Tax retry phase is still single-shot per Advance.** Edge case
  where one tax retry unblocks one invoice and exposes another
  retryable invoice in the same Advance — that second one waits.
  Low real-world impact; not fixed in this pass.
