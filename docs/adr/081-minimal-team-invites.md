# ADR-081: Minimal team invites (no RBAC)

Date: 2026-07-06
Status: Accepted
Amends: ADR-011 (which shipped single-user auth and deferred invites)
Trigger: DP-readiness cut-reinstatement #2 ("Single dashboard seat" in the
DP-readiness register, maintained in the internal `velox-ops` repo) — a
self-hosted pilot puts the installing platform
engineer, the billing operator, and finance on one shared password within
30 days, and the append-only audit log becomes attribution-blind with one
user, undercutting a feature the README sells.

## Decision

Ship the smallest thing that kills the shared password; keep RBAC cut.

1. **Invite by email, tokenized accept.** `POST /v1/members/invite` creates
   a `member_invitations` row (migration 0139; the 0035 ancestor belonged
   to the cut Members feature and was dropped in 0068) and sends an accept
   link through the transactional email outbox. Token discipline mirrors
   password reset: 32 random bytes, only sha256 stored, single-use via CAS
   on `accepted_at`, 7-day TTL (invites mint a NEW account for a colleague
   possibly on PTO; reset is 1h because it targets an existing one). One
   PENDING invite per (tenant, email), enforced by a partial-unique index.

2. **No RBAC — role recorded, not enforced.** Every member's session gets
   the full owner permission set (`auth.KeyTypeSession`, unchanged).
   Invited users are recorded as `role='member'` (user_tenants CHECK
   expanded owner→owner/admin/member in 0139) so the future role split has
   honest data, but nothing reads the role today and the UI says so.

3. **Membership endpoints are dashboard-session-only** (`auth.RequireSession`).
   Inviting and removing humans is a human act; API keys carry no user
   identity to attribute it to, and the audit trail needs a person.

4. **Accept is trust-tiered.** A NEW account sets its password during
   accept and gets a session minted (same trust as a completed password
   reset). An EXISTING account is attached but NOT logged in — possession
   of an inbox must not open an already-privileged account; they sign in
   with their own password.

5. **Removal revokes sessions.** Sessions pin (user, tenant), so deleting
   the membership row alone leaves live sessions working until expiry;
   `RemoveMember` calls `sessions.RevokeAllForUser`. Guards: no
   self-removal (lockout footgun), never the last member (unrecoverable
   workspace without psql).

6. **No enumeration oracles.** Invalid, expired, revoked, and consumed
   tokens all collapse into one generic 422. The accept endpoints ride the
   `/v1/auth` rate-limit block so token guessing is throttled like
   credential stuffing.

7. **Email failure is loud.** If the outbox enqueue fails, the invitation
   row is revoked before the error returns — a pending row with no email
   is a dead end that also blocks re-invites via the partial-unique index.
   Invites refuse to mint at all when `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL` is unset
   (accept links are never derived from request headers — same
   host-header-poisoning posture as password reset).

## Still cut (unchanged)

Role enforcement, per-role permission maps, invitation resend (revoke +
re-invite covers it), 2FA, SSO (ADR-014 direction stands). The permission
map swap-over point is documented at `internal/auth/permission.go`.

## Consequences

- Two humans on one tenant no longer share a credential; audit rows carry
  real per-person actors (`member.invited`, `member.joined`,
  `member.removed`, `member.invite_revoked`).
- When RBAC lands, users recorded as `member` will visibly LOSE access
  they implicitly had — the UI copy ("every member has full access — 
  per-role permissions are coming later") pre-frames that.
- v1's "each user belongs to exactly one tenant" login assumption
  (user/handler.go picks `tenants[0]`) now has a real multi-tenant case:
  an existing user accepting an invite to a second workspace. 0139 adds
  `user_tenants.created_at` and TenantsForUser orders by it, so login
  deterministically lands on the FIRST-joined workspace; a tenant
  switcher is future work and will ride the session's TenantID (already
  per-session, not per-user). On a single-tenant install — the pilot
  shape — the only existing-user accept is a removed member re-invited,
  which round-trips cleanly.
