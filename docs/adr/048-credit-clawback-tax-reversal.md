# ADR-048: Credit clawbacks reverse proportional tax via the credit-note primitive

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Supersedes/relates: ADR-039 (credits = the discount primitive), ADR-042 (integer proration math), the cancel/prebill-relief work (#22)

## Context

When Velox claws back part of an **already-paid, taxed `in_advance`** charge — a mid-cycle **plan downgrade**, a **mid-cycle cancel** of a paid prebill, or a **plan swap** — it credits the customer for the unused time. Today all three paths grant a **bare net (tax-exclusive) amount** to the customer credit ledger and reverse **no** output tax:

- downgrade proration — `subscription/handler.go` (`proratedCents < 0` → `GrantProration`)
- cancel paid-prebill — `engine.go BillOnCancel` (paid path → `creditGranter.Grant`)
- plan swap — `engine.go BillOnPlanSwapImmediate` (→ `creditGranter.Grant`)

The customer **paid gross** (net + tax) for that unused slice. Crediting only the net is a **latent cash-short bug**: a net credit balance offsets a *future gross* invoice 1:1, so the customer ends up short by the tax slice on any taxed invoice — and the tenant's upstream output-tax liability is never reduced, so it over-reports/over-remits relative to what it actually keeps.

Industry (Stripe / Chargebee / Lago) handles this with a **credit note** that reverses proportional tax against the original invoice. Velox already has that primitive (`creditnote.Service`), and the **unpaid**-prebill cancel branch (`relieveUnpaidPrebillOnCancel`) already uses it correctly. The three paths above are the inconsistent ones.

A tempting shortcut — adding a tax column to the credit ledger and grossing up the grant — is **wrong**: the ledger has no tax breakdown and is consumed as a pure cash offset on `amount_due`, with no place to file an authority-side reversal. A gross-on-the-ledger grant would refund the customer's tax as cash with **no** offsetting reversal → the tenant over-remits. Tax reversals belong on the **credit-note** document, anchored to the original invoice's committed `tax_transaction_id`.

## Decision

Route all three clawbacks through the existing tax-reversing **credit-note** primitive (`creditnote.Service.CreateAndIssueAdjustment`), against the **resolved original paid `in_advance` invoice** (already looked up at every site via `FindBaseInvoiceForPeriod`):

1. **Gross up** the net unused amount to the invoice's gross via its own `Total/Subtotal` ratio (`money.RoundHalfToEven(net × Total ÷ Subtotal)`; `1×` for zero-tax) — identical to `relieveUnpaidPrebillOnCancel`.
2. `CreateAndIssueAdjustment(src.ID, grossUnused, reason, desc)`. On a **paid** source invoice, `Issue` credits the full gross to the customer's **balance** (same spendable `CreditGrant` ledger entry as today) **and** reverses the proportional output tax against the original `tax_transaction_id` (no-op for manual/none providers — gated on `tax_transaction_id != ""`). The tax slice is derived from the **original invoice ratio** (`inv.TaxAmountCents × subtotal ÷ inv.TotalAmountCents`) with a last-CN residual true-up, so tax-inclusive pricing and floor() residuals are handled by construction and repeated clawbacks can't over-reverse (bounded by the per-invoice over-credit cap).
3. **Replace** the bare net grant at each site (never add alongside it — that would double-credit). The **unpaid**-prebill branch (`relieveUnpaidPrebillOnCancel`) is left untouched (it reduces `amount_due`, grants no balance, and must not become a balance-crediting CN).
4. Invoice **display**: present the upgrade proration as the two-line credit-unused-old + charge-new shape (the structurally tax-correct view), with plain-English labels.

When the credit-note adjuster is unwired (narrow unit tests only — production always wires it), fall back to the legacy net ledger grant so existing tests pass.

## Why this is correct (verified)

Cash-neutral and tax-correct, and strictly better than today: the customer gets back the **gross** they paid for the unused slice (which offsets a future gross invoice 1:1), and the tenant's authority-side liability is reduced by exactly the reversed tax — two separate ledgers, no double-count (the reversal never touches the credit ledger or `amount_due`).

## Consequences

- A clawback now produces a **credit note** (a tax document) instead of a bare ledger grant. Operator-visible artifact changes; the customer's spendable balance outcome is preserved (and corrected upward by the tax they overpaid).
- Each clawback CN must be anchored to the resolved source invoice id so the over-credit cap + cumulative tax true-up see prior clawbacks.
- Rolled out in phases: (A) engine cancel + plan-swap — **shipped** (#185); (B) downgrade proration — **shipped** (#186); (C) the two-line upgrade display — **shipped** (#187). Tracked in #184 (closed).

## Phase B notes (downgrade / quantity-decrease / item-remove)

The subscription handler gained a narrow `CreditNoteIssuer` dependency (`*creditnote.Service` satisfies it directly — same method as `billing.CreditNoteAdjuster`, no adapter). The downgrade-credit branch grosses the net clawback up by the resolved paid source invoice's `Total/Subtotal` ratio and issues the tax-reversing CN against it; the legacy bare-net `GrantProration` remains only as the fallback when the issuer is unwired (narrow tests) or no paid source invoice was resolved.

The CN is issued **after** the atomic item-change tx commits — `creditnote.Service` is not tx-aware and its tax reversal is an external Stripe call, so it can't ride the DB tx (a rollback would orphan a committed CN + balance grant). This mirrors the post-commit tax-commit established in #183.

**Dedup without a schema migration** (this is where the plan changed from the original "relocate the proration-source dedup onto the CN"): a client retry of the same downgrade is rejected at `Service.UpdateItem`'s no-op gate (the item is already on the new plan / new quantity), so the CN is never issued twice. The source invoice's per-invoice over-credit cap is the hard backstop against any aggregate over-credit. No new column / index was needed. The residual crash window (item committed, CN not yet issued, retry blocked by the no-op gate) leaves the customer un-credited until reconciliation — logged at error level; same risk class as #183's post-commit tax commit, accepted rather than carrying a heavier tx-aware credit-note refactor pre-launch.

## Phase C notes (two-line upgrade display)

A mid-cycle **plan upgrade** invoice now presents the structurally-correct two-line shape every reference platform converges on (Stripe / Recurly / Chargebee / Orb): a **negative** credit "Unused time on `<old plan>` (after `<date>`)" plus a **positive** charge "Remaining time on `<new plan>` (after `<date>`)", summing to the same net the single line used to show. A single "$18.00 plan upgrade proration" line is opaque ("I upgraded to $50 — why $18?"); the credit-unused + charge-remaining pair shows the arithmetic.

Key decisions:

1. **Display/structure only — the invoice total is provably unchanged.** Tax is still computed **once on the net** via `ApplyTaxToLineItems`, then the stored lines are partitioned *after* the tax call. The invoice `subtotal_cents` / `tax_amount_cents` / `total_amount_cents` are taken from the same `taxResult` as before, byte-for-byte.
2. **Never hand a signed line to the tax provider.** Stripe Tax rejects a negative line `Amount` (the invoice would spuriously defer to draft) and the manual provider clamps a negative base to zero (mis-apportioning the tax). So the split runs strictly *after* the single-net-line tax call. The credit line carries the **negative** reversed-tax slice (`round(T × credit ÷ net)`), the charge line the residual (`T − creditTax`) — `creditCents + chargeCents == net` and `creditTax + chargeTax == T` exactly, by deriving the charge halves as residuals rather than independently rounding.
3. **Scope = real plan change.** Add-item and quantity changes share the `proratedCents > 0` branch but have no distinct old plan to name as "unused time on …", so they keep the single net line. Gated on `change_type == plan`.
4. **Inclusive-tax fallback.** When inclusive-mode tax carves the net (`taxResult.SubtotalCents != proratedCents`), the split is skipped and the single net line stays — avoids any subtotal/line mismatch in the rare inclusive case.
5. **No new line type, no migration.** Both lines stay `base_fee`; `invoice_line_items.amount_cents` has no `>= 0` CHECK, so the negative credit line persists fine. Both `formatCents` (web + PDF) already sign-handle negatives; the PDF/web per-jurisdiction rollups only render for multi-jurisdiction invoices, and the web rollup's skip was aligned to `=== 0` (was `<= 0`) so a negative-tax line is included and the rows still sum to `invoice.tax_amount_cents` — mirroring the PDF's `== 0`.

## Amendment (2026-06-15): clawback credits fan across ALL invoices that funded the period

A period prepaid by **more than one** invoice (the day-1 base invoice **plus** a mid-period upgrade / quantity-increase proration invoice) broke the original single-source assumption. The cancel / cross-interval plan-swap credit is sized off the post-change base — correct, and equal to the unused prepayment across *both* invoices — but it was issued as one credit note against the single invoice `FindBaseInvoiceForPeriod` resolves, overran that invoice's per-invoice credit-note cap, hard-errored, and was swallowed to a silent $0 (a customer overcharge). See the 2026-06-15 money-bug audit.

- **Resolution:** a new `invoice.FindFundingInvoicesForPeriod` returns the full funding set (base-fee-line predicate ∪ the `subscription_update` invoice's header — `billing_reason` + `source_plan_changed_at ∈ period` + `billing_period_end`, all already-populated columns, **no migration**). `billing.settleUnusedAcrossFunding` partitions the **one authoritative** figure across the set with `money.AllocateByWeight` (largest-remainder); each piece is grossed up and tax-reversed against **its own** invoice's `tax_transaction_id`. Per-source reversal is *strictly more* ADR-048-correct than one blended reversal when the base and upgrade invoices carry different rates.
- **Partition, never independent recompute.** The shares partition the engine total rather than being recomputed per invoice — otherwise upgrade→downgrade→cancel double-counts (credits $80 for $40 of real unused). The over-credit guard is structural: the parts sum to the authoritative total by construction.
- **Fail loud.** A share that still can't be issued returns a hard error; `subscription.Service.Cancel` / the swap path log it at `slog.Error` ("customer not credited; manual credit required") instead of the prior silent warning, while keeping the terminal cancel/swap non-blocking on a transient credit failure.
- **Void / mark-uncollectible** reverse only the **remaining** un-credit-noted tax (`amount_paid + amount_due`), not a blind full reversal, so an invoice that already had adjustment credit notes isn't double-reversed (output-tax under-remittance).
- **Downgrade-clawback leg (done — distinct attribution):** unlike cancel/swap's *uniform* clawback of all unused prepayment, a downgrade/qty-decrease/item-removal claws back only the *removed* value, so it attributes per change type: a **plan downgrade** reverses **LIFO** (newest funding invoice first — undo the latest price level against its own tax, leaving the still-active base untouched; `money.AllocateLIFO`); **fungible** quantity/item changes split **proportionally** (`money.AllocateByWeightCapped`). Each piece caps at its invoice's remaining headroom; `ProrationDetail.ClawbackPieces` carries them and `issueClawbackCreditNote` issues one credit note per piece. Resolution is read-only inside the atomic item-change tx, so headroom exhaustion **rolls the change back pre-commit** rather than the post-commit reconcile gap. Industry-anchored (Stripe flexible mode reverses the original charge; per-charge credit memo is the dominant downgrade model).
- **Headroom-awareness (done):** the cancel/swap fan-out now caps each share at *remaining* creditable (`creditnote.Service.CreditedCents`) and water-fills overflow, so a **downgrade then cancel** doesn't overrun the invoice the downgrade already credited.

## The FUNDING-SET invariant (made explicit 2026-06-15)

The whole multi-invoice class above existed because one cardinality lived only as the single-row return shape of `FindBaseInvoiceForPeriod`, never as a named contract — so when this ADR (two-line upgrades / immediate proration invoicing) made a period fundable by **more than one** invoice, the readers (cancel / swap / void / downgrade) silently inherited the stale assumption. Now stated as a rule and enforced:

> **A subscription period can be funded by multiple invoices** (a base invoice + any mid-period upgrade / quantity-increase proration invoice). Any code computing a **period-wide credit, clawback, or void** MUST reconcile against the full set via `invoice.FindFundingInvoicesForPeriod` — never a single-row lookup.

- **Enforcement:** `scripts/lint-funding-set.sh` (CI: `make lint-funding-set`) fails on any `FindBaseInvoiceForPeriod` / `GetByProrationSource` call in the proration decision packages without a same/preceding-line `// single-invoice-ok: <reason>`. The legitimate single-row uses today are the paid/unpaid **routing gate** (the per-invoice math still fans across the funding set) and the proration-**dedup replay** (an idempotency lookup).
- **Funding set excludes usage:** threshold / usage / manual invoices are *not* funding — they bill consumed usage, never prepaid base, and so are never clawed back. The resolver excludes them via the `line_type='base_fee'` + period-start predicate.
- **Related tax invariant (void/uncollectible):** **tax is reversed only by credit notes.** Payments and applied customer credit reduce `amount_due` without reversing tax, so `reverseInvoiceTax` computes the remaining un-reversed gross as `total − Σ(non-voided credit notes)` (`CreditNoteTotaler`), not from `amount_due`.
