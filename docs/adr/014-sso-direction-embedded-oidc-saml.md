## Context

ADR-011 ships homegrown email+password for the dashboard and Bearer keys
for the API, with the deferred question: "what shape does SSO take when
a design partner asks for it?" Earlier memory and the README left this
loose with phrasing like *"WorkOS / Zitadel deferred until a design
partner asks"*, which has caused recurring confusion in planning
sessions ("are we using WorkOS?" → no, but the doc reads ambiguous).

This ADR closes that loop with a concrete direction so the next time
SSO comes up, the path is predetermined and one less decision under
DP-deadline pressure.

### What the OSS landscape actually does (researched 2026-05-02)

Auth stacks across peer self-hostable OSS dev tools:

| Project | Default OSS auth | SSO path |
|---|---|---|
| Cal.com | NextAuth.js + native creds | BoxyHQ Jackson (in-process SAML/OIDC) |
| n8n | Homegrown bcrypt + roles | Built-in SAML (paid) |
| Plausible CE | Homegrown bcrypt | Community-requested, not shipped |
| PostHog | Django auth | OAuth + multi-tenant SAML in-process |
| Supabase | `supabase/auth` (GoTrue fork, embedded Go service) | OIDC/SAML in-process |
| Metabase | Homegrown + Google OIDC + LDAP | SAML/JWT paywalled (Pro/Enterprise) |
| Outline | None — external IdP required | Customer's Keycloak/Authentik/etc. |
| Penpot | Homegrown + LDAP + generic OIDC | OIDC built-in |
| **Lago (OSS billing)** | Homegrown bcrypt + JWT | Okta paywalled as Enterprise add-on |
| **KillBill (OSS billing)** | Apache Shiro embedded; RBAC in OSS | LDAP/external IdP via Shiro |

The dominant pattern: **homegrown password auth for the OSS tier; SSO
delivered as in-process OIDC/SAML libraries that talk to whatever IdP
the customer already runs**. WorkOS / Auth0 / Clerk / Stytch all
require an account at their SaaS — disqualifying for any product whose
positioning is "runs entirely in your VPC."

### Velox-specific constraints

- **Self-host is a core wedge.** Velox's positioning is "the open-source
  billing engine for AI and usage-heavy SaaS — runs in your own VPC."
  Any auth path that requires reaching workos.com / auth0.com /
  clerk.com at runtime breaks that promise. Air-gapped customers exist
  in the target market (regulated tenants, EU GDPR-strict, India RBI
  data localization).
- **Single binary deployment is a feature.** Velox is one Go binary +
  Postgres. Forcing customers to also deploy and operate Keycloak or
  Authentik as a precondition for login would be a regression.
- **Customer's IdP is variable.** A DP might run Okta, Entra (Azure
  AD), Google Workspace, Keycloak, Authentik, JumpCloud, or
  PingIdentity. Velox can't pick one vendor. Standards-based OIDC and
  SAML are the only thing every IdP speaks.

## Decision

When SSO becomes a real DP requirement (the trigger named in ADR-011 +
`project_auth_decision`), Velox will:

1. **Stay homegrown for the password path.** Do not migrate
   `internal/user` to a third-party identity service. The bcrypt +
   sessions recipe in ADR-011 is the OSS default and stays.
2. **Embed OIDC and SAML libraries in-process** for SSO, using
   `github.com/zitadel/oidc/v3` and `github.com/zitadel/saml`. Apache-2.0
   licensed Go libraries from a credible upstream (Zitadel — modern,
   actively maintained), shipped as imports, no separate Zitadel
   server to deploy.
3. **Wire SSO via per-tenant config**: `tenant_settings.sso_oidc_issuer`,
   `tenant_settings.sso_saml_metadata_url`, etc. The tenant points
   Velox at their IdP; Velox initiates the OIDC/SAML flow at runtime
   inside its own process. No SaaS dependency, no Velox-owned IdP.
4. **RBAC stays homegrown.** Roles + permissions in `users.role` /
   `user_tenants.role` (already partially built per ADR-011),
   middleware-enforced. KillBill is the model — embedded RBAC in OSS,
   not a paid add-on. Whether RBAC ever becomes a paywall is a
   pricing-and-packaging decision separate from the auth-vendor
   decision and out of scope here.

### What is rejected

- **WorkOS / Auth0 / Clerk / Stytch as the OSS default.** SaaS-only
  deployment models break the self-host wedge. Disqualifying.
- **External Keycloak / Authentik as a hard requirement.** Adds an
  operational burden no DP has asked for and breaks the single-binary
  story. Optional integration via OIDC is fine — that's just "your
  Keycloak is the IdP, Velox is the OIDC client" and falls out of
  decision #2 for free.
- **Paywalling SSO as the enterprise upsell, Lago-style.** This ADR
  doesn't decide pricing; it decides architecture. SSO ships in OSS by
  default because once the OIDC/SAML libs are imported, gating them
  costs more than not gating them. Paywall decisions, if they ever
  happen, gate higher-tier features (RBAC fine-grain, audit-log
  retention, etc.) rather than the protocol surface.
- **WorkOS as a hosted-Velox-only optional integration.** Could be
  reconsidered if hosted Velox ever exists; not on the OSS tier path.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Air-gap safe.** No outbound runtime calls for auth.
- **Single binary stays single binary.** The OIDC/SAML libs add
  ~200–400 lines of integration code, not an extra service.
- **IdP-agnostic.** Any standards-compliant IdP works on day one —
  Okta, Entra, Google Workspace, Keycloak, Authentik, JumpCloud,
  PingIdentity, Rippling, OneLogin. Beats Lago's "we charge for the
  Okta connector" framing.
- **No vendor lock-in.** Zitadel libs are Apache-2.0 Go. If Zitadel as
  a project disappears tomorrow, the libraries are still in our `go.sum`
  and forkable; OIDC/SAML are open standards regardless.
- **Closes the WorkOS-confusion loop.** Future planning sessions can
  point at this ADR instead of re-litigating the vendor question.

### Negative

- **More integration work than buying.** ~200–400 lines vs. zero with a
  managed AuthKit. Acceptable: the integration is a one-time cost, the
  vendor dependency would be permanent.
- **No flashy hosted login UI out of the box.** Have to render our own
  login page (already done in `web-v2/src/pages/Login.tsx`) and our
  own `/auth/sso/initiate` redirect flow. Standard work.
- **Self-hosted ops own the IdP.** A customer who doesn't run an IdP
  can still use email+password — unchanged from today. SSO is purely
  additive. Customers who want SSO bring their own IdP, which is
  exactly the assumption every IdP-agnostic enterprise tool makes
  (and what they expect anyway).

## Trigger to revisit

- A design partner explicitly demands SSO / SAML / MFA.
- A second human on a tenant needs named-actor audit attribution
  (multi-user RBAC).

## References

- ADR-011 — email+password dashboard auth, ground truth for the OSS path.
- `feedback_pre_launch_scoping` memory — defer features without named
  customer demand; this ADR is the design predetermined for when that
  demand arrives.
- `project_auth_decision` memory — kept aligned with this ADR.
- `feedback_amend_decisions_when_course_changes` memory — the WorkOS
  ambiguity in the previous version of `project_auth_decision` is
  exactly the silent-deviation pattern this ADR closes.
