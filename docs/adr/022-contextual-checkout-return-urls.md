# ADR-022: Stripe Checkout return URLs are contextual, not global

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-04

## Context

Operator-reported bug: setting up a payment method from the customer
detail page → Stripe Checkout opens in a new tab → operator clicks
Cancel → SPA renders a **blank page** at `localhost:5173/checkout/cancel`.

Trace:
- `STRIPE_CHECKOUT_CANCEL_URL=http://localhost:5173/checkout/cancel`
  was set in `.env.example` and read by `payment.NewCheckoutHandler`
  at boot.
- The handler stamped that exact URL on every Stripe Checkout session
  it created.
- The SPA had a route for `/checkout/success` (a "Payment successful"
  landing page) but **no matching route for `/checkout/cancel`**, so
  cancel hit the SPA's catch-all → blank.

Fixing the blank page would have been a one-line "add the missing
route." But the deeper issue was the design: **global return URLs are
the wrong primitive**. Every other Checkout-creating flow in the
codebase already uses contextual return URLs:

| Flow | Return URL | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted-invoice Pay | `{base}/invoice/{public_token}` | `internal/hostedinvoice/handler.go:457` |
| Customer-portal update PM | `req.return_url` (defaulted to `/customers/{id}?payment=updated`) | `internal/payment/portal.go:73` |
| Public token-authenticated update | tenant config or invoice page | `internal/payment/public_handler.go:142` |
| **Operator-side `/checkout/setup`** | **`STRIPE_CHECKOUT_*_URL` env (global)** | `internal/payment/checkout.go` |

The operator-side setup flow was the outlier. Stripe's own
documentation, Vercel, Linear, and Recurly all follow the contextual
pattern: cancel = "back where you came from," not a stateless
"you canceled" page that loses customer context.

## Decision

`/checkout/setup` adopts the contextual-return pattern that the rest
of the codebase already uses:

1. **`setupRequest` accepts an optional `return_url` body field.**
   The operator's SPA passes the page they were on
   (`window.location.origin + window.location.pathname`).
2. **Handler appends `?payment=success` / `?payment=cancel`** to the
   return URL. SPA reads the query param on mount, toasts the result,
   refetches `payment_setup`, and strips the query so refresh doesn't
   re-toast.
3. **Default fallback (when `return_url` is unset)** is
   `/customers/{customer_id}?payment=…`. Always valid because every
   setup flow has a `customer_id`.
4. **`STRIPE_CHECKOUT_SUCCESS_URL` + `STRIPE_CHECKOUT_CANCEL_URL`
   removed** from `.env.example`, `deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml`,
   `deploy/compose/.env.example`, and the `payment.NewCheckoutHandler`
   constructor signature. Boot no longer reads them.
5. **`web-v2/src/pages/CheckoutSuccess.tsx` and the
   `/checkout/success` route deleted.** No flow targets them now.

## Consequences

- **Cancel now lands the operator back on the customer detail page**
  with `?payment=cancel`, which surfaces a `toast.info("Setup
  canceled — no changes were made")` and removes the query.
- **Success now lands the operator back on the customer detail page**
  with `?payment=success`, which surfaces `toast.success("Payment
  method saved")` and refetches `customer-payment-status` so the card
  details render immediately. The webhook is still the authoritative
  path that flips `customer_payment_setups.setup_status` → `ready`;
  the toast is just a UX hint that the redirect landed.
- **Every Checkout-creating flow now follows the same pattern.** No
  more outlier. Adding a new flow means "pick the page the user came
  from" rather than "add another env var."
- **No migration needed.** Pre-launch, no operators are relying on the
  env vars in production.

## Alternatives considered

- **Add the missing `/checkout/cancel` SPA route.** Fixes the blank
  page in one line but leaves the wrong design in place. Cancel still
  loses customer context — the page can't link back to the customer
  detail without re-fetching from `session_id`.
- **Template the customer_id into the env URL** (e.g.
  `…/checkout/cancel?customer_id={CUSTOMER_ID}`). Stripe's URL
  templating only supports `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`, not arbitrary
  variables. We'd have to look up customer from session — extra
  round-trip for no gain over just using the customer page directly.
- **Keep the env override as a power-user knob** with the contextual
  default underneath. Adds two config surfaces for one capability.
  Pre-launch with one operator, the env knob is pure config debt.
