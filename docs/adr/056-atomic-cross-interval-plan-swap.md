# ADR-056: Cross-interval plan swap restructures the cycle atomically

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

An adversarial audit of the proration/billing write paths (2026-06-18) found the immediate **cross-interval** plan swap (e.g. monthly→yearly "upgrade to annual", same cadence) ran as **four non-atomic writes across two domain stores** in `applyCrossIntervalPlanSwap`:

1. `BillOnPlanSwapImmediate` — refund the unused OLD in_advance prepayment (credit/credit-note)
2. `ApplyItemPlanImmediately` — write the new plan onto the item
3. `UpdateBillingCycle` — advance the watermark to `(now, newPeriodEnd)`
4. `BillOnCreate` — bill the NEW in_advance period (day-1 invoice)

No shared transaction wrapped them. Two verified money-failure modes:

- **Silent revenue drop (reachable, no crash needed).** Step 3 advanced the watermark *before* step 4 billed. If `BillOnCreate` failed — and it fails on a *routine* tax-calc hiccup (`ApplyTaxToLineItems` → Stripe Tax `customer_data_invalid`, missing address, provider blip) — the code logged `"scheduler catchup will retry"` and returned success. **That comment was false.** The cycle close skips in_advance base segments (`engine.go` Pass-1 guard: `if segPlan.BaseBillTiming == BillInAdvance { continue }`, assuming they were prepaid by `BillOnCreate`), and the watermark had already moved past `(now, newPeriodEnd)`, so the new plan's day-1 base was **never billed — a permanent, silent revenue leak.**
- **Double-credit on full retry (narrow, deferred).** The refund (step 1) carries no retry-stable dedup key. If step 1 commits and step 2 fails, a retry re-enters the swap and re-credits. This needs a precise crash window between two sequential writes *plus* a retry, and is bounded per source invoice by the credit-note headroom cap.

**Reachability.** Both require `base_bill_timing = in_advance`, which is a live, validated API field (default `in_arrears`, ADR-031). Cross-interval same-cadence swaps are a core operation; cross-**cadence** (in_advance↔in_arrears) is rejected upstream. So the silent drop is genuinely reachable; the double-credit is narrow + bounded.

The add / quantity / same-interval plan-change path was **already atomic** — the handler owns one `*sql.Tx` and threads it through the subscription store's `*Tx` methods + `CreateInvoiceWithLineItemsTx` (ADR-030). Cross-interval was the one path left non-atomic, documented as a follow-up.

## Decision

Make the cross-interval swap **atomic via the same coordinator-owned-`*sql.Tx` pattern** the add/qty path already uses — no cross-domain import (the coordinator holds the tx and passes it into each domain store's `*Tx` method). Fix the **reachable** silent drop; **defer** the narrow double-credit (Bug B) with a written trigger.

**One transaction (rolls back fully on any failure):**

```
handler.atomicUpdateItemWithProration owns the tx
  └─ svc.UpdateItemTx → applyCrossIntervalPlanSwapTx(tx, …)
       ├─ ApplyItemPlanImmediatelyTx   (plan write)
       ├─ UpdateBillingCycleTx          (watermark advance)
       └─ BillOnCreateTx                (new in_advance day-1 invoice)   ← in_advance only
```

The watermark can no longer advance unless the new-period invoice commits in the **same** tx. A failed in-tx bill aborts the commit and rolls back the plan write + watermark — **the silent drop is structurally impossible.**

**External steps run POST-commit** (Stripe must never ride a DB tx):

- the OLD-period **refund** (`BillOnPlanSwapImmediate`, computed from the pre-swap snapshot so plan lookups resolve the outgoing rate), and
- the new invoice's **tax commit + auto-charge** (`FinalizeOnCreateInvoice`),

both via `FinalizeCrossIntervalSwap` after `tx.Commit()`. (The tax *calculation* is computed inside the tx, matching the existing atomic proration path — only the tax *commit*, charge, and refund are deferred.)

**Engine factoring.** `BillOnCreate` is split into `buildOnCreateInvoice` (compute + tax, no writes/number) + a slim `BillOnCreate` (build → mint number → `CreateInvoiceWithLineItems` → `FinalizeOnCreateInvoice`, behavior-identical for its existing callers) + `BillOnCreateTx` (build → mint number → `CreateInvoiceWithLineItemsTx`, no finalize) + exported `FinalizeOnCreateInvoice`. `applyCrossIntervalPlanSwapTx` builds a *prospective* in-memory subscription (swapped plan, new period) for `BillOnCreateTx`, because `store.Get` cannot observe the uncommitted tx writes.

**Loud-fail.** The non-atomic fallback (reached only when the handler tx is unwired — tests) no longer logs the false "catchup will retry" WARN; it returns the error.

## What is explicitly deferred

- **Bug B — refund double-credit on full retry.** The post-commit refund is not itself idempotent, so a full operator/SDK retry of a swap could re-credit. It is narrow (precise crash window + retry) and bounded (per-invoice credit-note headroom cap), and closing it cleanly needs either an idempotency-key middleware (closes the class generally) or folding the credit-note's DB write into the tx with a split external tax-reversal. **Trigger to revisit:** a real in_advance design partner, or when idempotency-key middleware lands. Moving the refund post-commit (vs the old refund-before-swap order) does not worsen B and removes the old "tx-rollback strands a refund" failure mode.

## Consequences

- No migration. New `*Tx` store/engine methods + interface additions (`InvoiceWriter.CreateInvoiceWithLineItemsTx`, `Biller.BillOnCreateTx` / `FinalizeOnCreateInvoice`); `*billing.Engine` already satisfies them.
- A rolled-back swap may leave a harmless invoice-number gap (`NextInvoiceNumber` is monotonic; gaps are acceptable, as on the cycle path). A duplicate-period retry inside the tx surfaces as a loud error + rollback (no false "idempotent skip").
- Cross-interval immediate swaps take the atomic path **unconditionally** — including at the period boundary (`remainingDays == 0`), where the handler forces it rather than falling to the non-atomic fallback (`applyCrossIntervalPlanSwapTx` derives the new period from `now`, not from `remainingDays`). The non-atomic `applyCrossIntervalPlanSwap` remains only for the handler-tx-unwired (test) path and now fails loud on a bill failure.
- A uniform-interval guard is enforced on the atomic path too: a multi-item swap that would leave items on mixed intervals is rejected (mirrors the non-atomic path) before any restructure, so unchanged items are never billed over the wrong period.
- Related: ADR-030 (atomic proration), ADR-031 (in_advance bill timing), ADR-055 (anniversary anchor — reused for the swap's re-anchor).
