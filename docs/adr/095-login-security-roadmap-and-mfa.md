# ADR-095: Login-security roadmap & MFA design — minimal-complete for a self-hostable B2B money dashboard

Date: 2026-07-17
Status: Accepted as the DESIGN OF RECORD. The **decision** is settled — pull **MFA + offline breached-password forward** out of ADR-094's indefinite "deferred," build them in the *safe-complete* form below, and mark the consumer-scale controls **never** for this product shape. **Implementation is deferred** (parked pending a full MANUAL_TEST pass, then Phase 1). No code ships from this ADR.
Relates: ADR-011 (email+password auth), ADR-014 (homegrown/embedded SSO+MFA, no SaaS vendor, air-gap constraint), ADR-081 (team invites, **no RBAC** — every member holds full permissions), ADR-093 (CSRF gate), ADR-094 (login brute-force protection — this ADR **refines** its deferred plan).

## Context

Velox's login surface is a **small, known, operator-only B2B dashboard** guarding Stripe keys and customer PII — not a consumer sign-in wall. A design review during the MANUAL_TEST walkthrough asked two questions ADR-094 left open: (1) should MFA + breached-password be pulled forward, given a serious B2B customer's security review will gate on them for a money product; and (2) which of ADR-094's deferred controls are genuinely needed for *this* shape versus consumer-scale over-engineering to cut.

To answer them without hand-waving, an **adversarial design panel** ran (four independent designs from different lenses — MVP, compliance/SOC2, self-host/air-gap, attacker-economics — each red-teamed, then synthesized). This ADR records the synthesized result.

### Process caveat (and corrections)

Two honesty notes about the panel:

- **One lens dropped** (attacker-economics) to a tooling failure; the synthesis ran on three fully red-teamed lenses. The remaining critiques covered the attacker-economics angle well, but the design **should get a fresh red-team pass at build time** (Phase 1), which happens naturally.
- **The panel agents inspected a stale worktree branch** (`fix/org-tz-seam-overbill`, predating this session's merges), so several of its "verified in-tree, current-state" claims are **wrong for `main`** and were re-verified. Corrections:
  - It flagged the weaponizable email-keyed lockout as "still live, no removal migration." **False on `main`** — `internal/user/lockout.go`, `users.locked_until`, and `ErrAccountLocked` were removed (#497→#499, migration 0154). That "remove the lockout" item is **done**.
  - It flagged `ClientIP` as trusting a spoofable leftmost `X-Forwarded-For`. **Already fixed on `main`** — `middleware.TrustedRealIP` only honors XFF from allow-listed trusted proxies.
  - Genuinely still open: the breached-password check is still the ~10-entry `commonPasswords` stub in `ValidatePassword`.

  Net: the panel's "Phase 0 NOW" list is *mostly already shipped*; only the breached-password set and a TLS/Secure-cookie prod check remain.

## Decision — the minimal-complete design

Keep the lean floor, pull exactly two things forward (MFA + breached-password), build MFA in a form that survives a security review, and refuse the consumer-scale machinery.

### Phase 0 — floor (mostly already shipped)

Keep bcrypt-12, the per-IP `/v1/auth` limiter, constant-time anti-enumeration (identical 401 + dummy bcrypt), the min-12 / 72-byte / common-password policy, the CSRF gate, session-revoke-on-reset, single-use hashed reset tokens, and `TrustedRealIP`. **Remaining Phase-0 work:** (a) replace the `commonPasswords` stub with the embedded offline breached set (below); (b) mandate TLS in production — `Secure` cookie in prod, plain-HTTP is **dev-only**. Reject the framing of plain-HTTP LAN as a *feature*: over HTTP the session cookie and TOTP are sniffable and MFA buys nothing against a LAN adversary.

### The strategic pull-forward: homegrown TOTP MFA (Phase 1)

MFA is the one control that covers the **stolen/stuffed correct-password** threat that bcrypt, policy, and any throttle cannot — and the line-item a B2B security review gates on for a Stripe-key holder. Build it in its **safe-complete** form; the pieces below are inseparable (shipping TOTP without them is the trap all three panel designs initially fell into):

- **Method:** TOTP per RFC 6238 (HMAC-SHA1, 6 digits, 30 s step, ±1 step skew, 160-bit `crypto/rand` secret), via a **vendored in-process pure-Go lib** (e.g. `pquerna/otp`, MIT). "Homegrown" (ADR-014) means *in-process, no SaaS, no runtime network* — not hand-rolled crypto. TOTP is the baseline over WebAuthn (origin-agnostic, no attestation/RP-ID config); WebAuthn/passkeys is a **later** additive phishing-resistant factor, not the baseline. **Not** SMS/email OTP.
- **Enrollment:** self-service in Settings→Security. Server mints the secret, stores it **AES-256-GCM-encrypted** (`VELOX_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; **fail-loud at boot** if MFA is enabled and the key is unset), marked *pending*, and returns an `otpauth://` URI + a **locally-rendered** QR data-URI (no external QR service; issuer/label from the deployment's configured name, validated so two self-hosted instances don't collide in an authenticator app). The user must enter one current code to **confirm binding** before activation (catches mis-scans).
- **Verification state machine — the load-bearing part** (omitted by every source design, flagged by every critique): a correct password mints a **short-TTL (~5 min), single-use, server-side partial-session bound to the RESOLVED user id** (never a client-supplied id) with **no dashboard access**; only a valid TOTP or recovery code upgrades it to the real `httpOnly velox_session` cookie. **Enforce at session-mint, not per-handler** (avoids a missed-gate hole).
- **MFA needs its OWN throttle** (the key insight): a 6-digit TOTP with ±1 skew is ~3 live codes per million — an **online-brute-forceable** secret the attacker attacks *after* passing the password. So the partial-session carries a **per-session OTP-attempt cap** (e.g. 5 wrong → invalidate, force password re-auth) plus a **single-use / last-consumed-timestep replay guard**. This cap is **non-weaponizable** — it only slows the already-password-authenticated OTP step, nothing like the removed account lockout.
- **Recovery:** 10 single-use, ≥128-bit, hashed-at-rest recovery codes, shown once at confirm, burned on use, regenerate-invalidates-prior + fires a notification. **Primary offline recovery — deliberately not email/SMS** (SMTP is optional here, and email shares the compromise surface — the same circularity that rules out email-OTP). Lost-everything fallback: a **break-glass MFA-reset subcommand in the MAIN `velox` binary** (so single-operator containers aren't bricked — not a separate `velox-admin` a locked-down PaaS may lack), audited (`mfa_break_glass_reset`) on every use. **Password reset must NOT short-circuit MFA** (post-reset login still presents the second factor).
- **Enforcement + the no-RBAC implication (ADR-081):** a per-user enrolled flag + an org-level `require_mfa` policy. Because there is **no RBAC** (every member holds full permissions), disabling MFA, toggling `require_mfa` off, or resetting another member's MFA must require **step-up re-auth or CLI break-glass** — never a bare shared-permission action, or one compromised member strips the org's second factor. **MFA is forced on the platform/bootstrap operator that holds the Stripe keys** — not left to a default-off toggle. Recommend `require_mfa` **default-ON for new orgs** (with an unmissable enroll nag), **default-OFF only for the very first bootstrapping operator** so they can't self-lock on day one.
- **Step-up re-auth for crown-jewel actions:** reveal/rotate Stripe keys, change payout/bank details, disable MFA, toggle `require_mfa`, view/rotate API keys, invite/remove members. Login is otherwise the only gate — a stolen 7-day session or an unlocked laptop would otherwise mean full key exfiltration with no re-challenge.
- **Audit vocabulary (repo-specific must-do):** the audit vocabulary is **closed and totality/CHECK-constraint-gated**. Adding MFA requires extending it — `mfa_enrolled`, `mfa_disabled`, `mfa_challenge_failed`, `recovery_code_used`, `mfa_break_glass_reset` — **with its CHECK-expansion migration in the same commit**, or the events are literally unrecordable and fail the totality test. Reference `user_id`, never plaintext email.
- **Security-notification emails** (best-effort, degrade gracefully when SMTP is absent): MFA disabled, recovery codes regenerated, password changed, new-device login. The one real-time signal that catches a silent takeover — passive audit rows nobody reads don't.

### Offline breached-password (Phase 0/1)

Reject known-breached passwords **at password-SET time only** (bootstrap-create, reset-confirm, future change-password), reusing the existing `ValidatePassword` seam. Ship an **embedded** (compiled into the binary — not a mountable sidecar that can be absent and silently fail-open) **exact-match ordered top-N (~1M by prevalence)** set (binary search / map: zero false positives, can't be absent, no filter tuning). Refresh out-of-band by rebuilding in a release — **never fetched at runtime**. **No** login-time recheck (MFA is the better answer to "a password later got breached"; login-time adds latency + a timing oracle + forced resets). **No** runtime `api.pwnedpasswords.com` call by default (air-gap); the HIBP k-anonymity API is at most an explicit opt-in for internet-connected deployments.

### Minimal `(IP × account)` soft throttle — conditional, simplified

The non-weaponizable account-facing brake for **non-MFA** users and a bcrypt-DoS damper: a Postgres-backed increasing-delay / temporary-429 on `(IP × account)` — **no bare account lock, and NO IP-prefix bucketing**. Prefix bucketing (/24, /64) is botnet-defeating consumer-scale sophistication for a distributed-guessing pressure that doesn't exist at zero customers; plain `(IP × account)` is the pre-launch-complete shape. This **refines ADR-094**, which specified prefix keying. Build it with the MFA package or when observed pressure appears — whichever first.

## Phased roadmap (with triggers)

- **Phase 0 — floor (mostly done):** remaining = embedded breached-password set + TLS/Secure-cookie in prod. *Trigger: immediate; small self-contained PRs.*
- **Phase 1 — the MFA package (committed pre-launch):** homegrown TOTP in the safe-complete form above (confirm-on-enroll, encrypted secret, partial-session, OTP-attempt cap, replay guard, recovery codes, break-glass, force-on-bootstrap-operator + `require_mfa`, step-up for crown jewels, audit-vocab extension + CHECK migration, security-notification emails, minimal `(IP × account)` throttle). *Trigger: **before onboarding the first external operator or the first DP security review** — built ahead of the deadline, not scrambled under it.*
- **Phase 2 — DP-triggered, additive:** embedded in-process OIDC/SAML SSO (`zitadel/oidc` + `zitadel/saml`, ADR-014); WebAuthn/passkeys as an additive phishing-resistant factor for HTTPS deployments; optional opt-in HIBP k-anonymity (off by default); RBAC to properly scope the `require_mfa` / MFA-disable boundaries. *Trigger: a named DP demand (SSO/SAML, hardware-key MFA) or a compliance control the enforced-MFA + top-N set doesn't satisfy.*
- **Phase 3 — conditional (only under observed pressure):** a self-hosted proof-of-work step-up rung, IP-prefix bucketing on the throttle, login-time breached recheck — each only if the concrete pressure shows in logs, none with CAPTCHA or a SaaS vendor. *Trigger: credential-stuffing / distributed guessing actually observed.*

## Do NOT build (never — for this product shape)

Structurally mismatched to an operator-only, air-gapped, tiny-user-set money engine; revisit only on a fundamental pivot to public/consumer signup:

- **Bare per-account hard lockout** (auto-lock after N fails) — weaponizable DoS (OWASP anti-pattern); never touches live sessions so it can't stop a compromised account. (Already removed; do not reintroduce.)
- **Aggregate credential-stuffing detection** (HLL fan-in / EWMA) — needs millions of accounts for a base rate; nothing to fan in at N-operators.
- **Graduated challenge ladder** (tarpit → CAPTCHA/PoW → step-up) — machinery for a public-signup population to grade; Velox has none.
- **CAPTCHA** (reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha/Turnstile) — outbound third-party calls break the air-gap constraint.
- **Risk-based/adaptive auth, device fingerprinting, impossible-travel, trusted-device remember-me** — need telemetry volume + a fraud model a known-operator set never produces.
- **SMS or email OTP as an MFA factor** — SIM-swap-weak / paid gateway / SMTP-optional and re-secures the account via the reset channel (circular).
- **Full 850M-hash HIBP corpus + login-time recheck**, and **runtime HIBP API as the default** — ~1 GB / maintenance burden that stops paying off once MFA is enforced; outbound HTTPS breaks air-gap.
- **IP-prefix bucketing on the throttle** — consumer-scale botnet defense for pressure that doesn't exist (Phase-3 conditional at most).
- **Edge-first bcrypt-DoS appliance / WAF tier** — incoherent with a single-binary self-host model (no shared edge to place it at).
- **Redis as a hard dependency** for throttling/lockout — self-host stays single-binary + Postgres.
- **Dedicated MFA-secret KMS/HSM/pepper-rotation subsystem** — one env AES-GCM key is enough for secret-at-rest.
- **SaaS auth vendor** (Auth0/WorkOS/Clerk/Cognito/Duo/Stytch) — ADR-014 hard constraint.

## Open decisions (to settle at Phase 1)

- **`VELOX_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` lifecycle:** document a backup + rotate-with-reencrypt runbook, and make a missing/changed key **degrade per-login-gracefully** (block MFA users, keep non-MFA login and the billing engine up) rather than boot-crash. A real mass-brick path if unspecified.
- **`require_mfa` default:** recommended default-ON for new orgs (enroll nag), default-OFF only for the first bootstrapping operator. Confirm acceptable vs. opt-in.
- **Clock drift:** air-gapped boxes drift without NTP; ±1 step is thin. Document a clock-sync requirement + a "server clock may be off" diagnostic rather than widening skew (which enlarges the brute-force window).
- **Breach-corpus shape/size:** embedded exact-match top-N (recommended) vs bloom filter; confirm N.
- **The Bearer `vlx_` API-key surface is owned-but-separate** — it's the credential that actually moves money, and MFA protects only the *dashboard* door. Name it explicitly (rotation/scoping/leak-response) so a security review isn't surprised.

## Relationship to ADR-094

This ADR **refines** ADR-094's deferred plan: **MFA + breached-password move from "deferred" to Phase 1 "next";** the consumer-scale items (ladder, HLL/EWMA, CAPTCHA, risk-based, edge tier) are reclassified **never** for our shape; the throttle is **simplified to plain `(IP × account)`** (prefix bucketing → Phase-3 conditional). ADR-094 remains the record of the brute-force-throttle reasoning; ADR-095 is the record of the *whole* login-security posture and the MFA design.
