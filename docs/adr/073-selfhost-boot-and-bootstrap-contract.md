# ADR-073: Self-host boot contract — one bootstrap writer, honored APP_DATABASE_URL, serialized hybrid migrations

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Status:** Accepted (shipped in P7; design amended by a 2-lens adversarial panel — both SHIP-WITH-FIXES)

## Context

Three self-host roots from the 2026-07-02 audit:

1. **Two bootstrap writers had already drifted.** The CLI
   (`cmd/velox-bootstrap`) creates tenant + settings + test/live keys +
   owner user; the HTTP `POST /v1/bootstrap` created tenant + two
   unmarked test keys — no owner user (dashboard login impossible), no
   live key, no settings seed. An HTTP-bootstrapped install was a
   dead end. Docs referenced `VELOX_OWNER_*` env vars nothing reads.
2. **APP_DATABASE_URL was documented but never read.** The runtime RLS
   pool was derived by swapping credentials to the hardcoded
   `velox_app:velox_app`; the production compose init script created
   the role with exactly that public password. Anyone with TCP reach to
   Postgres had cross-tenant read/write.
3. **The hybrid migration runner raced.** `upHybrid` decided what to
   apply from an UNLOCKED read of `schema_migrations`; two replicas
   booting together could double-apply a no-tx migration, rewind the
   version, or (the panel's blocker) mis-dispatch a `CONCURRENTLY`
   file through the library's in-tx path — a deployment-wide dirty
   crash-loop.

## Decisions

1. **One bootstrap writer.** `tenant.RunBootstrap(ctx, db, deps, opts)`
   is the only code path that provisions a tenant; the CLI and the HTTP
   handler are thin callers. It runs **everything in ONE bypass tx** —
   `pg_advisory_xact_lock(LockKeyBootstrap)`, the exists/uniqueness
   guards re-checked under the lock, tenant insert, `tenant_settings`
   seed, three keys (`vlx_secret_test_`, `vlx_secret_live_`,
   `vlx_pub_test_`; livemode pinned per insert against the 0021
   trigger), owner user + tenant attach via an injected tx-scoped
   `deps.CreateUserTx` (tenant must not import its peer `user`).
   All inputs validate BEFORE the first write (email shape; password
   hashed up front — `user.HashPassword` enforces
   `MinPasswordLength = 12`): a malformed request can no longer commit
   a half-bootstrap that 409s forever after (the old orphan window the
   CLI comment admitted is deleted, not documented).
   Guard order on the HTTP handler: **already-bootstrapped 409 →
   token-unset 403 → constant-time compare 403 → run**. A bootstrapped
   install answers a uniform 409 regardless of token validity or
   presence — the perpetual token-validity oracle and the
   token-configured oracle are both gone; the disclosure of
   virgin-install state is accepted (rate-limited since P12, and the
   409 pre-check is one cheap SELECT). Owner email/password are
   optional request fields (defaults: `admin@velox.local`, generated
   96-bit password) returned once with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
   The bootstrap token must never appear in a query string (body or
   Authorization header only — keeps it out of proxy access logs).
2. **APP_DATABASE_URL honored verbatim; production fails closed.**
   - Set → used as-is for the app pool. Unopenable = fatal in EVERY
     env (explicit config never silently degrades).
   - Set, non-local, and its password is empty (trust-auth shape),
     `velox_app`, or equal to its username → fatal.
   - Unset, non-local → fatal ("set APP_DATABASE_URL…"). Unset, local →
     today's `velox_app:velox_app` derivation, warn-and-fallback
     unchanged.
   - **Runtime-role capability check** (the actual closure of the
     finding — both panel lenses ruled it in scope): after opening the
     app pool, `SELECT rolsuper OR rolbypassrls FROM pg_roles WHERE
     rolname = current_user`; true = fatal non-local, warn local. This
     catches the post-fix path of least resistance — copying
     DATABASE_URL into APP_DATABASE_URL — which the string checks
     cannot see. Table-ownership is NOT checked: every RLS table uses
     `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, so owners are subject; only
     superuser/BYPASSRLS capability defeats it.
   - `VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, when set in non-local, must be ≥ 16
     chars (config.validateFatal) — it mints the owner login and the
     live key, so a guessable token is deployment takeover.
3. **The whole hybrid migration loop is serialized**, not just
   `applyNoTx`. `upHybrid`/`rollbackHybrid` take a Velox-owned
   session-scoped advisory lock (`LockKeyMigrateHybrid` — deliberately
   NOT golang-migrate's derived id, which would deadlock the library's
   own `Lock()`) on a dedicated conn for the loop's whole duration.
   Under that lock the loop's per-iteration version+dirty reads are
   authoritative: the loser replica skips already-applied versions
   instead of double-applying, rewinding, or mis-dispatching a no-tx
   file through the library's in-tx path. `applyNoTx` keeps its
   internal golang-migrate-id lock (cross-path guard against a
   concurrent pure-library runner mid-step).
   **Acquisition POLLS `pg_try_advisory_lock`** (500ms interval, 30-min
   loud-fail cap) rather than blocking on `pg_advisory_lock`: the
   racing-appliers test caught that a blocked lock statement holds a
   snapshot for as long as it waits, and the winner's `CREATE INDEX
   CONCURRENTLY` must wait out every older snapshot — a mutual wait
   Postgres cannot detect (advisory waits aren't in its deadlock
   graph). Two replicas booting together would have deadlocked the
   deploy. Try-lock statements hold nothing between polls.
4. **The compose stack ships what its own topology requires**
   (panel: these are wiring, not doc riders):
   - a `redis` service + `REDIS_URL` (APP_ENV defaults to production
     there, which fail-closes the rate limiter — without Redis the
     bootstrap/login walkthrough 429s and invites the `APP_ENV=local`
     workaround that silently reopens the RLS fallback);
   - `VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD` passed to BOTH services (init script runs
     in the postgres container), consumed via `psql -v pw=… PASSWORD
     :'pw'` (correct literal quoting), with `openssl rand -hex 24`
     guidance so the DSN stays URL-safe by construction; existing
     pgdata volumes upgrade via the same `ALTER ROLE … PASSWORD :'pw'`
     recipe (doc note only — pre-launch, no migration tooling);
   - `TRUST_PROXY` defaulting to the compose network's private range
     (nginx fronts the API; without it every client shares one
     rate-limit bucket keyed on the nginx container IP and audit logs
     record the proxy);
   - `SMTP_TLS`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL`,
     `VELOX_EMAIL_BIDX_KEY` passthroughs; fabricated
     `VELOX_DASHBOARD_*` and phantom `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (nothing
     reads it — Stripe webhook secrets are per-tenant in the DB)
     removed.
5. **Docs route operators to the real path.** `docs/self-host.md`
   labels the `make dev` flow as local development and points
   production self-hosters at `deploy/compose/` as the canonical
   walkthrough; bootstrap credentials are shown being retrieved ON the
   VM (`http://localhost/v1/bootstrap`) with an explicit
   don't-send-over-plain-HTTP note (compose's nginx is :80; TLS stays
   out of v1 scope).

## Accepted residuals

- HTTP bootstrap key prefixes change from unmarked `vlx_secret_` to
  mode-marked (`vlx_secret_test_`/`vlx_secret_live_`) with no compat
  shim — pre-launch; the unmarked form parsed as LIVE, which is itself
  a reason it dies.
- `VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD` is visible in `docker inspect` alongside its
  sibling secrets — moving one var to docker secrets while
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`/`VELOX_ENCRYPTION_KEY` stay in env would be
  theater on a single VM.
- The `app.bypass_rls` GUC remains reachable by any role holding valid
  credentials — RLS defends against app bugs, not hostile SQL clients;
  the password perimeter above is the load-bearing fix.
- Two pure-library replicas racing (no pending no-tx files) rely on
  golang-migrate's own lock, as before.

## Test locks (real Postgres, mutation-verified)

Bootstrap: two concurrent POSTs → exactly one 201/one 409/one tenant;
invalid password → 422 with ZERO rows written, retry succeeds, login
works; HTTP result has owner user + live key + settings row (parity by
construction). Migrate: loser-skips (schema_migrations pre-advanced →
hybrid runner applies nothing, no dirty, no rewind); two racing
`migrate.Up` from before the last no-tx version both return nil with
correct final version. Boot: fail-closed matrix unit tests
(unset/default/empty-password/username-equal × env) + capability-check
fatal on a BYPASSRLS role.
