# ADR-067: Archive blocks new business — it never cancels, and it never lies

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Status:** Accepted (shipped in P2a)

## Context

Archiving a customer did nothing to their subscriptions — billing,
auto-charge, and dunning continued — while the dashboard dialog promised
"billing will stop for their subscriptions" (audit HIGH #4: unauthorized
charges against explicit operator intent). Two candidate fixes: cancel
subscriptions server-side on archive, or block the archive until the
operator cancels them.

## Decision

**Archive = 409-BLOCK while any subscription still bills. Never auto-cancel.**

Auto-cancel is a trap: `Cancel()` runs the immediate-cancel billing path —
final prorated invoice plus **auto-charge of the saved card** — so "archive
to stop billing" would itself charge cards, N times in a bulk archive loop,
and drags the full ADR-056/057 proration machinery into a hide-this-customer
action. Blocking keeps archive a pure visibility/intent flag:

- `customer.Update` rejects active→archived while any subscription is
  non-terminal (active or trialing — including active with a scheduled
  cancel, which bills until the boundary), via a narrow
  `SubscriptionChecker` wired from `api/router.go` (zero peer-imports;
  `SetStripeSyncer` precedent). **Fails closed** when unwired. The 409 names
  the blocking subscription ids.
- `subscription.Create` rejects archived customers (archive = no new
  business). Archived **plans** get the same guard at Create and both
  plan-swap paths (`UpdateItem`/`UpdateItemTx`); existing items on an
  archived plan keep billing (archive ≠ cancel).
- Existing unpaid invoices remain collectible and dunning continues — both
  are invoice-driven and deliberately survive archive.
- The dialog copy now states exactly that. No backfill for already-archived
  customers (pre-launch); no belt-and-suspenders engine-side skip.

**Billing-profile currency guard (same checker):** the profile currency
overrides the plan currency at every invoice writer, so an unvalidated
currency silently re-denominated plan prices ($100 plan invoiced as €100 —
no conversion). `UpsertBillingProfile` now normalizes to canonical
UPPERCASE, format-validates ISO-4217 alpha-3, and 409-rejects a currency
that mismatches a billing subscription's plan currency.

**Hosted-invoice settle poll (shipped alongside, audit HIGH #6):** with
`?paid=1` the public invoice page polls every 3s until the payload's
`payment_status` turns terminal — authoritative backend state, no
heuristics. Pay is suppressed for the entire settle (past the 3-minute cap
the copy turns honest and Pay STAYS hidden; async methods legitimately run
long, and a live Pay button during settle is how cards get charged twice).
Pay returns only on authoritative `payment_status=failed` (no charge
exists). Complements P2b's Checkout session reuse.

## Test locks (mutation-verified)

`TestArchive_BlockedWhileSubsBill` (+ per-status subtests, message names the
sub), `TestArchive_AllowedWhenOnlyTerminalSubs` (+ unarchive),
`TestArchive_FailsClosedWithoutChecker`, `TestBillingProfileCurrency_Guard`
(mismatch 409 / case-normalize / format 400),
`TestCreate_RejectsArchivedCustomer`, `TestCreate_RejectsArchivedPlan`
(+ active-plan control). Each guard deleted → its test fails.
