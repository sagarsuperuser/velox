# ADR-068: Checkout session dedup — claim-first ledger, choke-point closes, loud anomaly settlement

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Status:** Accepted (shipped in P2b-a; two build-time adversarial panels — 3 lenses each — amended the plan's sketch, see plan §4.2)

## Context

`POST /v1/public/invoices/{token}/checkout` minted a **fresh** Stripe
Checkout session on every call: no idempotency key, no `ExpiresAt`
(Stripe default = 24h), no expiry on settle. A customer paying on two
devices — or re-opening a dunning email — was charged twice, the second
charge visible only in Stripe; the settle path silently dropped the
duplicate success (audit HIGH #5).

## Decision

### Claim-first ledger (`checkout_sessions`, migration 0125)

A POST **claims before it mints**: an `open` row is inserted in a
transaction that re-verifies the invoice payable under `FOR SHARE`
(serializes against the settle's `FOR UPDATE` paid-flip — a session can
no longer be minted after expire-on-settle already ran), rejects
in-flight charges (`payment_in_progress` 409 — dunning auto-retry racing
the Pay click), and re-anchors the amount on the locked row. The Stripe
create runs post-commit with an **idempotency key derived from the claim
id**: a crash before the row is filled, a concurrent loser, or any retry
re-drives the create and receives the **same session**. The partial
unique index (one open row per invoice) is the concurrent-double-POST
guard; the loser reads the winner's claim **on a fresh tx** (the unique
violation aborts the claiming tx — found by test) and returns the same
URL. `ExpiresAt=1h` is set **on the Stripe create params** (a DB-only
TTL leaves a ~23h invisible payable session); Stripe's clamped actual
expiry is persisted, and the reuse read refuses rows at/past it
(CAS-supersede, exactly one racer remints).

**Amount drift** (a credit note legally changes `amount_due` while a
session is open — "open" is not "in flight", so ADR-059's CN guard does
not apply): the POST branches on the Stripe-side truth before minting —
a **completed** session means the customer just paid the old amount, so
no new session is minted (409; the webhook settle + escalation own it);
already-expired proceeds; a network failure is the accepted ≤1h residual.

### Exits from payable close claims at store choke points, in-tx

The panel counted 9+ scattered "exit from payable" writers vs the
sketch's four categories. Instead of per-call-site hooks, the claim rows
close **inside the exiting transaction** at the three store choke points
everything converges on: `markPaidReportingTransition` (every MarkPaid
variant), the void/uncollectible status transition, and **both**
`amount_due` reducers (`ApplyCreditNoteTx`, `ApplyCredits` — any
reduction supersedes the claim; its minted amount is stale). The
Stripe-side network expire is post-commit best-effort (settle-time sweep
over every unresolved session for the invoice, including previously
superseded ones); per-session `ExpiresAt` is the backstop.
`checkout.session.completed` truth-syncs the row.

### Loud anomaly settlement

`SettleSucceeded` now takes the **captured amount** (the webhook parses
it; previously discarded) and escalates three per-cause anomalies via
one channel — `slog.Error` + outbound event + a **durable marker** on the
invoice (migration 0126) that drives a **Critical attention banner which
pierces the classifier's terminal-state early-return** (a duplicate
charge fires on an invoice that is already *paid*; with auto-refund
deferred, the operator is the refund mechanism):

- `payment.duplicate_charge` — a second, *different* PI succeeded on a
  paid invoice. The `transitioned=false` skip point compares against the
  row **returned by the FOR-UPDATE transition**, never the caller's
  stale snapshot (checkout invoices record their PI only at settle — the
  stale comparison would false-alarm every routine concurrent same-PI
  redelivery). An empty recorded PI escalates (credits/offline-settled
  invoice hit by a live card charge).
- `payment.amount_mismatch` — captured ≠ booked at settle (the drift
  residual must be *detected*, never silently booked: `amount_paid`
  drives the refund cap).
- `payment.received_on_voided_invoice` — the transition's InvalidState
  on a voided target now escalates its own cause and **absorbs** (the
  webhook no longer retries a terminal invoice forever). The money is
  owed back — distinct from a double-collect.

## Accepted residuals (do not re-litigate)

≤1h drift/orphan windows bounded by Stripe-side ExpiresAt when a network
expire fails; pre-deploy sessions are outside the ledger (expire ≤24h —
upgrade note in CHANGELOG); Stripe-account rotation mid-session (expire
404s on the old account) — bounded by the same 1h; no auto-refund — the
attention banner + per-cause events are the operator's refund trigger; a
full session-sweeping reconciler stays deferred (the
`checkout.session.completed` truth-sync covers the common dropped-webhook
shape).

## Test locks (mutation/fault-verified)

`TestClaimOpen_ConcurrentDoublePOST_OneWinner` (real PG),
`TestClaimOpen_PayableRecheck`, `TestSupersede_CASExactlyOnce`,
`TestChokePointCloses` (MarkPaid/void/credit; strip a choke statement →
fail), the four `TestSettleSucceeded_*` escalation seams (incl. the
stale-snapshot false-alarm mutation), and the attention-pierce test.
Stripe-interaction legs (idempotency-key convergence, ExpiresAt params,
drift branching) are covered by the MANUAL_TEST flow — no HTTP-level
Stripe stub harness exists in-repo yet; building one is named follow-up
work, not silently skipped.
