# ADR-080: Paid-commit credit-note relief (ADR-078 phase 2)

Date: 2026-07-06
Status: Accepted
Supplements: ADR-078 (prepaid commits phase 1), ADR-061 (atomic CN issue)
Design basis: docs/design-commit-cn-relief.md (3-lens divergent panel +
adversarial judge; the cap arithmetic was mechanically verified against
`internal/platform/money/round.go` before acceptance).

## Context

ADR-078 shipped commit invoices as cash instruments with NO unwind for the
paid state: credit notes 409'd on any commit invoice, and only the UNPAID
path had relief (void retires the grant). Migration month is hand-built
commit invoices paid via `RecordOfflinePayment` — a wrong amount, wrong
customer, or churn with unused commit hit a dead end.

The hard problem is the **discounted commit**: pay $9,000, granted $10,000.
Refunding remaining credits at face lets a customer draw at discount and
refund at face (over-refund); charging consumption at face under-refunds.

## Decision

1. **Telescoping price-ratio anchor.** `f(k) = RoundHalfToEven(GrossPaid × k, Granted)`
   with `K = cn_retired_cents` (cumulative credits retired by relief CNs,
   a real column on the grant row). A relief retiring `r` credits refunds
   **`X = f(K+r) − f(K)`** gross. Worked example (9000 paid / 10000
   granted / 4000 consumed): max refundable = f(10000) − f(4000)… i.e.
   with K=0 and r=remaining 6000, X = **5400** — not 6000 (face), not
   5000 (face-minus-face). Telescoping makes ANY partial sequence sum to
   exactly `f(K_final) ≤ GrossPaid`; per-slice independent rounding is
   forbidden (it over-refunds: GrossPaid=2, Granted=3, three 1-credit
   slices → naive pays 3). **The anchor has exactly one call site
   computing CN cash** (`commitReliefCash`) — a second site reintroduces
   the rounding bug.
2. **Single coordinator tx, create-and-issue.** The relief CN is created,
   flipped issued, and the credits retired in ONE tx
   (`CreateAndIssueCommitRelief`): crash pre-commit leaves nothing;
   post-commit only the external legs (Stripe refund / tax reversal)
   remain, both idempotency-keyed and sweep-recovered — credits are
   retired at-or-before cash leaves, never refunded-but-drawable.
   Deliberately NOT the ADR-061 draft+reconciler shape: this is
   operator-initiated and idempotency-keyed at the HTTP layer, and a
   draft would neither reserve the document cap nor survive Issue()'s
   credit-channel re-derive default (the requirement-f hazard). Do not
   "fix" it into a draft flow.
3. **Partials in CREDITS, cash always derived.** `retire_cents` (int) or
   `retire_all` — which resolves to the LIVE remaining inside the tx, so
   a racing drawdown shrinks the relief instead of failing it; an
   explicit over-ask fails typed with the live numbers (never a silent
   clamp of an approved money document). Cash-denominated input may ship
   later as pure UI sugar.
4. **The credit channel is structurally forbidden** on relief (allocation
   = refund and/or out_of_band only): paying relief from the customer's
   balance would refund the very block being retired. Offline-paid
   commits (the `out_of_band:` PI marker) default to the out_of_band
   channel — the CN records the obligation; cash moves outside.
5. **Retire primitive single-sourced.** `retireCommitSliceTx` is the one
   retirement core; the void leg (slice = remaining, silent no-op on a
   missing grant, no K bump, `commit_void_retire`) and the relief leg
   (explicit slice, LOUD on a missing grant, K bump,
   `commit_refund_retire`) are thin wrappers — the complete
   commit-retirement writer set.
6. **Gates.** Unpaid commit → void (unchanged). Ordinary line-based CNs
   and `POST /invoices/{id}/refund` stay 409 on commit invoices with
   routing messages (cash ≠ face makes line-cap semantics wrong). Mixed
   commit+other-line invoices → 409 (trigger: first DP mixed-invoice
   refund ask). Expired grants → 409: term lapse is contractual breakage,
   earned cash; post-expiry goodwill is a promotional grant or
   out-of-band cash, never a cash CN. A zero-cash slice (deep-discount
   rounding) → 409 rather than a silent credit donation.
7. **Cap basis.** `GrossPaid = invoice.TotalAmountCents` — full-settle
   holds because Velox has no partial payments and commit invoices cannot
   be credit-paid. If partial capture ever ships, switch to captured cash.
8. **Wrong-price runbook.** Ratio corrections are FULL relief + reissue a
   corrected commit invoice — every relief preserves GrossPaid/Granted by
   construction, so partial relief cannot fix a wrong ratio.

## Consequences

- `credit.commit_retired` outbound event (in-tx with the retire) +
  `commit_retired_cents` on the CN document; auditors reconcile
  `grant.cn_retired_cents == SUM(cn.commit_retired_cents)` and recompute
  every relief from `(GrossPaid, Granted, K)`.
- Known blind spot (accepted): Velox models no card disputes — a disputed
  commit PI leaves the invoice paid while cash is pulled; the card refund
  leg fails safe at Stripe (loud `refund_status=failed`), the out_of_band
  channel has no backstop. Trigger: first dispute-modeling ask.
- Dashboard relief dialog is a fast-follow; the API carries the full
  contract (grants burndown endpoint reports remaining; error messages
  carry live max-refundable figures).
- Ratio-integrity invariant (no writer grows `amount_cents` or shrinks
  `consumed_cents` on a commit grant) holds today by construction and is
  pinned by tests, not a speculative gate.
