# ADR-094: Login brute-force protection — Postgres-authoritative, non-weaponizable, extensible

Date: 2026-07-17
Status: Accepted as the DESIGN OF RECORD; implementation DEFERRED. An interim
first-cut throttle shipped (PR #497) and was then removed to keep v1 lean — see
"What actually ships" below. The old weaponizable lockout stays removed, and the
dormant `users.locked_until` manual backstop was removed too — v1 has no login
lockout or throttle of any kind. Login brute-force protection (the throttle + MFA
+ breached-password check) is deferred as one unit.
**REFINED BY ADR-095** (2026-07-17): an adversarial design panel moved MFA +
breached-password from "deferred" to the next build phase, reclassified the
consumer-scale controls below (graduated ladder, HLL/EWMA aggregate detection,
CAPTCHA) as **never** for this operator-only shape, and simplified the throttle to
plain `(IP × account)` (prefix bucketing → conditional). See ADR-095 for the whole
login-security posture and the concrete MFA design; the brute-force-throttle
reasoning below still stands.
Relates: ADR-011 (homegrown email+password auth — the login this protects), ADR-014 (SSO stays homegrown/embedded, no SaaS auth vendor — same self-host constraint), ADR-093 (CSRF gate — sibling pre-auth hardening)

## Context

The dashboard operator login (email+password → httpOnly cookie, ADR-011) shipped
with a brute-force lockout: a per-email failed-login counter in Redis, an
in-process fallback behind a circuit breaker, and a hard `users.locked_until`
lock after 5 misses (velox-ops #21). Walking it end-to-end surfaced three
problems worth fixing at the root rather than patching:

1. **It fragments.** The count lives in *two* stores (Redis + the in-process
   fallback) that never merge. During a Redis flap, some attempts land in Redis
   and some in memory, loosening the effective threshold to ~2× — the exact
   distributed-counter footgun the two-store design invites.
2. **It is weaponizable.** A hard lock keyed on a *bare account* means anyone who
   knows an operator's email can lock them out on demand (5 wrong guesses → 15
   minutes of denial). This is the on-demand DoS lever OWASP explicitly cautions
   against; account lockout is a known anti-pattern.
3. **It leaks PII.** The Redis key was `velox:login_fail:<PLAINTEXT-EMAIL>` —
   operator emails in a store visible via `KEYS`/`SCAN` and RDB/AOF snapshots,
   the same class the audit #485 arc spent effort purging.

A design panel (5 independent architectures, each adversarially red-teamed, then
scored and synthesized) produced the target design below. This ADR records that
target in full so it is predetermined. An interim first cut was built (PR #497)
and then removed (see "What actually ships"): at zero customers, with no named
attacker pressure, a partial throttle whose real value only arrives alongside the
deferred MFA + breached-password controls was premature complexity to carry.
Login brute-force protection is deferred as **one unit**, to be built to this
design rather than grown from a stub.

## The target design (documented now, built incrementally)

The load-bearing insight from the panel, which every proposal reached
independently: **a failed-attempt counter only catches attackers who *guess*.**
Credential stuffing and password spray often submit the *correct* (breached)
password and succeed on the first try — no counter ever ticks. So the throttle is
the cheap outer supplement; the controls that actually stop the dominant threats
are **mandatory MFA/step-up** and a **login-time breached-password check**
(HIBP k-anonymity, or a shipped local Pwned-Passwords filter for air-gapped
operators — consistent with ADR-014's self-host constraint).

Architecture (defense in depth, from cheap/outer to real/inner):

- **Postgres is the single durable AUTHORITY** for both the counter-floor and the
  escalation decision. Login already hard-depends on Postgres (it reads
  `password_hash`), so making the throttle authoritative here adds **no new
  SPOF** and there is no second store to diverge from — the fragmentation class
  is gone by construction.
- **Optional accelerators strictly ABOVE the authority**, governed by two
  invariants so every degradation fails *safe*: (I1) accelerators write through
  to the Postgres floor and, on degradation, *seed from* it rather than starting
  a fresh parallel count; (I2) **ratchet-monotonicity** — an accelerator may only
  make a decision *more* restrictive; only a full authenticated success relaxes
  it. Under these, an asymmetric partition can at most *over*-restrict slightly,
  never the unbounded *loosening* of today's dual-count.
- **The counter is a sensor, not a gate.** It feeds a **graduated ladder**
  (tarpit → CAPTCHA/PoW → post-password step-up/MFA), never a hard account lock.
  The only hard block attaches to the **attacker dimension** — `(IP-prefix ×
  account)` — so a party who knows only an email can, at worst, force the owner
  through one self-clearing challenge they always pass. There is deliberately no
  bare-account lock: a compromised operator account is handled out-of-band by
  password reset (which revokes sessions) / disable, not by refusing its login.
- **Multi-dimension keying:** per-`(IP-prefix × account)` (the hard-block dim),
  per-account and per-IP-prefix sensors, a sharded global rollup, and an HLL
  fan-in (distinct IP-prefixes per account) — the last two **alert-only**, never
  fed back into a per-request decision (that would be a global-friction DoS
  lever). IPs are keyed on prefixes (IPv4 /24, IPv6 /64); a bare IPv6 address is
  2⁶⁴ fresh sources. Every subject is `HMAC(pepper, …)`, never plaintext.
- **Fail direction, per component:** Postgres shares fate with auth (down = login
  down anyway, correct). Redis accelerator: fail-*open* for latency, fail-*closed*
  for security (fall through to the Postgres floor; never drop the check, never
  wholesale-block on a blip; emit a degraded metric — loud, not silent).
- **Self-host tiers, one code path:** full (Redis + N instances), single
  instance, and multi-instance-no-Redis all work because the authority is always
  Postgres; aggregate-only dimensions degrade to a boot-WARN + a metric, never a
  silent no-op.

The panel's rejected alternatives (kept so the reasoning survives): a blocking
`pg_advisory_xact_lock` on the write path (connection-pool self-DoS); an exact
sliding-window-*log* COUNT (quadratic under the flood it measures); Redis as the
authority or a hard multi-instance dependency (wrong shape for a self-hostable
product); a single multi-key `EVALSHA` (Redis Cluster CROSSSLOT); RedisBloom
CMS/TopK (unloadable on managed/self-host Redis); hard account lockout as the
primary response; distinct `429`/`account_locked` responses (enumeration oracle);
ASN/shared-IP as a hard-block dimension (collateral DoS); and treating hashcash
PoW as a strong control (a botnet out-computes a phone).

## What actually ships

The design above is the record of where login protection is going. v1 ships none
of it — login is bare email+password behind the per-IP `/v1/auth` limiter — and
removes the old machinery so nothing dormant lingers:

1. **The weaponizable, fragmenting lockout is removed entirely.** Deleted
   `internal/user/lockout.go` (the Redis + in-memory + circuit-breaker
   `FallbackFailureCounter`), the `FailureCounter` interface, `SetFailureCounter`,
   and `Service.RecordFailedAttempt`.
2. **The `users.locked_until` backstop is removed too** (column dropped in
   migration 0154, along with `Store.Lock` and `ErrAccountLocked`). After #497
   nothing wrote to it — it was a dormant manual lock with no wired caller, and a
   weak one: a lock only gates the login endpoint, never live sessions, so it
   can't actually stop a compromised account. Incident response for a compromised
   operator account is **password reset (revokes all sessions) / disable**, not a
   login lock. Removing the lock also removes the login timing-oracle concern at
   the source — there is no second check to order after bcrypt.
3. **No automatic per-account throttle ships.** An interim `LoginGuard` +
   `PostgresLoginGuard` — a fixed-window failed-login counter keyed on
   `HMAC(pepper, ip_prefix|account)` (migration 0152, `login_throttle`) — was
   built in PR #497 and then removed (migration 0153 drops the table): a partial
   throttle whose real value only lands with the deferred MFA + breached-password
   controls was premature complexity to carry at zero customers. Login brute-force
   protection is deferred as **one unit** (below), built to the target design
   rather than grown from this stub. Until then, the per-IP `/v1/auth` rate
   limiter is the brute-force floor.

## Deferred (documented, triggered)

The whole protection is deferred; these are the phases, cheapest-outer to
real-inner:

- **The `LoginGuard` seam + the Postgres `(IP-prefix × account)` throttle** — the
  first buildable layer (built in #497, since removed). Rebuild it to the
  target design: the `Check`/`Record` seam, `HMAC(pepper, …)` subjects (a dedicated
  pepper key, or `crypto` derivation from `VELOX_ENCRYPTION_KEY`), and a fixed
  window. Trigger: any real user traffic, or the MFA phase below (whichever first).
- **MFA / step-up (TOTP homegrown, per ADR-014) and login-time breached-password**
  — the controls that actually stop distributed stuffing. *These are the highest
  security value and should lead the next phase.* Trigger: any real user traffic /
  a DP security review (ADR-011/014 named "a DP demands MFA/SSO").
- **The graduated ladder** (tarpit → CAPTCHA/PoW → step-up) behind the existing
  `Decision` seam — replaces the current allow/deny with softer rungs.
- **Aggregate credential-stuffing detection** (per-account fan-in HLL, per-IP
  spread, global-rate EWMA) as **alert-only** observability + runbooks.
- **The optional Redis accelerator** under the I1/I2 invariants, if the
  failed-login path ever becomes hot (it essentially never does for operator
  login).
- **A dedicated throttle pepper key** (separate from `VELOX_ENCRYPTION_KEY`), and
  a **retention sweep** (`DELETE WHERE window_start < now() - ttl`) wired on the
  scheduler — the throttle table's only growth vector; negligible at operator-
  login volume, so deferred with the throttle itself.

### Resource protection (bcrypt-DoS) — a SEPARATE axis, mostly not app-level

Everything above answers "is this the real person?" (protect the *account*). It
does nothing for "are we being flooded?" (protect the *service*). These are
different problems and must not be conflated: bcrypt is deliberately ~100–250ms
per verify, so it is a CPU **amplifier** — a distributed login flood that never
guesses a password and never beats MFA can still pin cores and starve
billing/ingest. **Do not ship MFA and declare brute force "solved": MFA protects
accounts, not CPU; the resource door stays open until the items below are.**

- **Edge-first.** Volumetric floods belong at the deployment edge — WAF/CDN, edge
  rate-limiting, per-IP connection caps, autoscaling — **not** in the binary.
  Building app-level DDoS machinery is over-engineering; the operator's reverse
  proxy is the front line (also why `TRUST_PROXY` matters). Industry norm: leaders
  offload auth and/or absorb floods at the edge, not with a bespoke in-app governor.
  **Self-hosted deployments almost always still run a reverse proxy / LB** (nginx,
  Caddy, Traefik, HAProxy, cloud LB) — if only for TLS termination — so an edge is
  nearly always present; the bare binary exposed directly is the rare exception. A
  plain proxy stops volumetric/connection floods but not *distributed* bcrypt
  amplification (it doesn't know `/v1/auth` is expensive). The cheapest fix for that
  is an **endpoint-scoped rate limit on `/v1/auth` at the proxy they already run**
  (nginx `limit_req`, Caddy, HAProxy stick-tables) — edge-layer, no app code.
- **Already shipped, and sufficient for now:** the per-IP `/v1/auth` limiter +
  the ingest bulkhead (separate bucket) — bounds per-source amplification and keeps
  a login flood off the ingest/billing budget. This is the correct app-level posture
  pre-launch; nothing to add.
- **The one in-app lever to add IF a self-hoster hits real abuse:** a **bounded
  login-CPU budget** — a semaphore / small worker-pool around the password verify,
  sized to a fraction of cores, that sheds excess to `429` *before* bcrypt. It is
  fail-safe (login degrades and recovers; billing/ingest keep running) and
  non-weaponizable (it bounds *total* login work, never targets an account). The
  ladder's CAPTCHA/PoW rung above does the same job from the other side — an
  unsolved challenge never reaches bcrypt.
- **Trigger — measured, not speculative.** Build it when `/v1/auth` request-rate +
  latency (already emitted by the metrics middleware) spike **and** coincide with
  rising latency/errors on non-login endpoints (billing/ingest) — i.e. login bcrypt
  is measurably stealing CPU from real work. A login spike alone is not enough; it
  must be hurting something else. And only once the cheaper layers can't absorb it,
  in order: (1) a cloud/horizontally-scaled deploy behind a real edge (WAF/CDN +
  autoscaling) likely **never** triggers — the edge sheds the flood and scale dilutes
  bcrypt; (2) a self-host behind its (almost-always-present) reverse proxy adds an
  **endpoint rate limit on `/v1/auth`** at that proxy first — still no app code. The
  in-app budget is the **sole** lever only in the genuinely edge-less corner (bare
  binary exposed, no proxy to endpoint-limit) under real distributed abuse — rare.
  NOT triggered by launch, customer count, or
  "feels risky." Cheap pre-work (do this instead of building): keep the signal
  watchable — `/v1/auth` rate+latency already is; add a bcrypt-concurrency gauge if
  the threshold ever needs to be unambiguous. Named here so nobody (a) bolts a CPU
  governor into the binary prematurely, or (b) calls brute force solved with the
  resource axis still open.

## Consequences

- **Removes a real DoS lever and a PII leak**, and eliminates the fragmentation
  class — a net security improvement even with no throttle in its place.
- **Honest reduction to be aware of:** v1 has **no automatic per-account
  brute-force control** on login. Repeated wrong passwords keep returning the same
  generic 401; the per-IP `/v1/auth` limiter is the only floor. A single-account
  brute force — distributed *or* from one source under the per-IP cap — is not
  throttled until the deferred layers land. This is stated, not hidden; the
  trigger to build is any real user traffic or a DP security review.
- MANUAL_TEST FLOW A1's account-lockout steps are removed in the same PR (there is
  no lockout or throttle behavior left to assert).

### Residuals to design against (they apply to the DEFERRED throttle, not to any shipped code)

Inherent to a lean IP-prefix throttle — recorded here so the rebuild designs
around them, and the reason the graduated ladder + MFA are the *real* fix:

- **TRUST_PROXY precondition.** The non-weaponizability rests on the client IP
  being the real client's. Behind a proxy with `TRUST_PROXY` unset, every peer is
  the proxy → all clients collapse to one prefix → the throttle degrades toward a
  bare-account lock. The rebuild should add a production boot-WARN; the real fix is
  correct deployment. **Do not run behind a proxy without `TRUST_PROXY`.**
- **Colocated-attacker collateral.** An attacker SHARING the owner's IP-prefix
  (same office NAT, CGNAT/mobile pool, VPN exit, cloud region) can hold the owner
  out ~15 min per 10 requests on the shared `(prefix × account)` subject. Narrower
  than the old any-email lock (needs colocation) but real; the deferred
  tarpit/CAPTCHA rung (a challenge the owner passes, not a block) is the fix.
- **IPv6 /64 granularity.** RIRs route /56–/48 to one customer, so a routed /56
  yields 256 /64s = 256× the guess budget against one email. `/64` is a tunable
  default; a coarser mask trades collateral for budget.
- **Concurrency burst (Check→Record TOCTOU).** Check and Record are separate
  statements, so a simultaneous burst can overshoot the threshold before an
  increment is observed — the throttle bounds steady rate, not a single burst.
  bcrypt cost-12 is the per-attempt floor; a pre-bcrypt concurrency cap is deferred.
- **Retention.** The throttle table's window rows are its only growth vector, so
  the rebuild needs a periodic sweep (`DELETE WHERE window_start < now() - ttl`)
  on the scheduler. At operator-login volume growth is negligible and stale rows
  are inert (ignored by the window predicate), so it can land with the throttle.
