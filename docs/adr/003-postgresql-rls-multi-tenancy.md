# ADR-003: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for Multi-Tenancy

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-04-14

## Context
Velox is multi-tenant: multiple organizations share the same deployment, each seeing only their own data. The three standard approaches are: (1) database-per-tenant, (2) schema-per-tenant, (3) shared tables with row-level isolation.

We needed tenant isolation that is secure by default — a bug in application code should not leak one tenant's invoices to another. At the same time, we wanted to avoid the operational complexity of managing hundreds of databases or schemas as the tenant count grows.

## Decision
All tenants share the same PostgreSQL tables. Every table includes a `tenant_id` column. PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforce isolation at the database level:

```sql
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON invoices
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id'));
```

Every transaction sets the tenant context via `set_config('app.tenant_id', $1, true)` in `postgres.BeginTx()`. The `TxTenant` mode sets `app.bypass_rls = off` and configures the tenant ID. A separate `TxBypass` mode (for cross-tenant operations like the billing scheduler) sets `app.bypass_rls = on`.

The application database user has RLS enforced; only the migration user can bypass policies. This means even a SQL injection vulnerability cannot cross tenant boundaries.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Defense-in-depth: tenant isolation is enforced by PostgreSQL, not just application WHERE clauses
- Single database to operate, back up, monitor, and migrate
- Shared indexes and connection pools across tenants — efficient resource utilization
- Adding a new tenant is a row insert, not a DDL operation

### Negative
- Large tenants sharing indexes with small tenants can cause query plan degradation (noisy neighbor)
- RLS adds a small overhead to every query (PostgreSQL must evaluate the policy predicate)
- Debugging requires setting `app.tenant_id` in psql sessions, which is unfamiliar to most developers
- `TxBypass` mode is a sharp edge — misuse could expose cross-tenant data

### Trade-offs
- We accept the noisy-neighbor risk because Velox v1 targets startups and mid-market (not enterprises with 100M+ rows per tenant). If a tenant outgrows shared tables, we can shard by moving them to a dedicated database — the `tenant_id` column makes this a data migration, not a code change.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Database-per-tenant**: Strongest isolation but operationally expensive. Each tenant needs its own connection pool, migrations run N times, and cross-tenant analytics require federation. Rejected for v1.
- **Schema-per-tenant**: Moderate isolation with simpler migrations than database-per-tenant, but still requires per-schema connection management and makes shared indexing impossible. Rejected.
- **Application-level WHERE clauses only**: Simpler to implement but one missed WHERE clause leaks data. In a billing system handling financial data, this risk is unacceptable. RLS is the safety net.
