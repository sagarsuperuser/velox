# ADR-047: Invoice-level `tax_rate` displays the statutory rate, not the effective rate

**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

A $100 invoice taxed by `stripe_tax` for a New York customer (combined NYC
rate **8.875%**) stored `invoices.tax_rate = 8.8800` and showed the customer
"Sales Tax (8.88%)". The amount was correct ($8.88), but **8.88% is not a real
NY rate** — it is `tax_amount × 100 ÷ subtotal` (`888 ÷ 10000`), the *effective*
rate, distorted upward by the half-cent rounding (`$8.875 → $8.88`). The true
statutory rate `8.8750` was already stored correctly on the line items (per
ADR-046's sibling fix, PR #165) but never reached the customer-facing tax line.

This is an `stripe_tax`-only defect. The manual provider sets
`EffectiveRate = m.rate` (`internal/tax/manual.go`) — it already reports the
configured statutory rate — so manual invoices were always correct. Only
`stripe_tax` computes `EffectiveRate = totalTax × 100 ÷ subtotal`
(`internal/tax/stripe.go`), which diverges from the statutory rate whenever
rounding bites.

The displayed rate, not the amount, is the issue. Industry practice is
unanimous that the rate shown is the *real* rate and the amount is rounded
independently:

- **Stripe** — the tax `percentage` is stored to **4 decimal places** and is
  "only used for rendering purposes to be shown on the invoice, separate from
  the actual calculated tax amount." Stripe has no single invoice-level "rate";
  it aggregates tax `per tax rate` and shows the statutory rate per line/rate.
  ([Tax rates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates),
  [Manual tax amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/manual-tax-amounts))
- **Zuora** — tax line items "display three decimal places when appropriate"
  for the rate, while subtotal/total "calculate to three decimal points then
  round after." ([Display tax information on invoices](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/B_Set_up_Zuora_Billing/Apply_taxes/Additional_resources_on_taxes/B_Display_tax_Information_in_invoices))
- **General rule (Dynamics 365 / TaxJar)** — calculate at higher precision
  (3–4 dp) internally; display the rate at its real precision and round
  *amounts* to currency precision after calculation.
  ([Dynamics 365 tax rounding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/localizations/global/tax-calculation-rounding-rules))

No surveyed platform back-computes `amount ÷ subtotal` and shows *that* as the
rate.

A separate, related question — "should we show per-line tax on the invoice?" —
was checked against the same sources: **no**. Stripe aggregates tax into a
single invoice-level line `per tax rate`; per-line tax rates exist only in
exports/reporting, not the rendered invoice. Velox's existing shape (one
aggregate tax line + a per-jurisdiction breakdown only when lines span >1
jurisdiction) already matches this; **unchanged** by this ADR.

## Decision

Persist the **statutory** rate as the invoice-level `invoices.tax_rate` when it
is well-defined, and only fall back to the effective rate when it is not.

New helper `displayTaxRate(lines, effectiveRate)` in
`internal/billing/engine.go`, called at the single write site in
`ApplyTaxToLineItems` (`app.TaxRate = displayTaxRate(res.Lines, res.EffectiveRate)`):

- If every **taxed** line (`TaxAmountCents > 0`) shares one rate → that
  statutory rate. Untaxed/exempt lines are ignored, so a taxed + exempt mix
  still counts as single-rate.
- If taxed lines carry **different** rates (genuine multi-jurisdiction, where no
  single statutory rate exists) → the blended `effectiveRate`.

Because every invoice-level `tax_rate` consumer is propagation, persistence, or
display (verified by full caller audit — see below), correcting the one write
site fixes all surfaces with no per-surface logic.

Two formatting bugs that compounded the field bug are fixed in the same pass —
both truncated even a correct `8.8750` down to `8.88`:

- **Frontend** `tax_rate.toFixed(2)` → new `formatTaxRate()` (`web-v2/src/lib/api.ts`):
  up to 4 dp, trailing zeros trimmed. Applied to `HostedInvoice.tsx` (customer),
  `InvoiceDetail.tsx` (operator), `Settings.tsx` (config echo).
- **Go PDF** `fmt "%.4g"` → new `formatTaxRate()` / `cnFormatTaxRate()` in
  `internal/invoice/pdf.go` and `internal/creditnote/pdf.go`. `%g` uses
  *significant figures*, which silently drops precision on rates ≥ 10
  (`13.875 → "13.88"`); fixed-decimal formatting prints the rate verbatim.

## Why this design

Correcting the stored value once (rather than deriving a display rate on each of
the three surfaces) is the single-source fix: it unifies `stripe_tax` with the
manual provider, needs no new API field, and leaves no room for the surfaces to
drift apart (`feedback_no_heuristic_proxies` — plumb the authoritative fact, don't
re-derive it per consumer; `feedback_no_belt_and_suspenders` — one path).

The effective rate is kept *only* for the genuinely-blended multi-jurisdiction
case, where it is the honest summary and a per-jurisdiction breakdown carries
the real per-rate detail. The header field has to stay effective there because
no single statutory rate exists — which is also why Stripe exposes no single
invoice-level rate.

`res.EffectiveRate` is still produced by both providers and remains on the
`tax.Result`; only the engine's choice of what to *persist* changed.

## Alternatives considered

- **A. Keep `invoices.tax_rate` effective; derive the display rate per surface.**
  Three implementations of the same "uniform line rate?" logic (Go PDF, two
  TSX), guaranteed to drift, and a frontend heuristic over data the backend
  already knows authoritatively. Rejected per `feedback_no_heuristic_proxies`.

- **B. Add a new authoritative `tax_display_rate` API field.** Correct but adds a
  column/serializer/codegen surface for a value we can already compute at the
  one write site. Over-engineered (`feedback_no_overengineering`) given no
  consumer needs both the effective and statutory rate.

- **C. Store statutory always, even for multi-jurisdiction.** There is no single
  statutory rate for a multi-rate invoice — the field would have to pick one
  line's rate arbitrarily. Rejected; the effective blend is the honest summary
  for that case.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Customer- and operator-facing invoices, PDFs, and credit notes show the real
  statutory rate (NYC: **8.875%**), matching Stripe/Zuora and what an auditor
  recomputes.
- `stripe_tax` and manual now agree on what `invoices.tax_rate` means.
- The `≥ 10%` PDF precision-loss bug (`%g`) is gone for all rates.

### Risks / open items
- **Semantic change to an existing field.** `invoices.tax_rate` now means
  "statutory when single-rate, else blended effective." Documented here, in
  `MANUAL_TEST.md` FLOW B2, and the `engine.go` helper comment. No code consumes
  the old effective-always meaning (full audit confirmed).
- **No backfill.** Pre-launch; existing finalized invoices keep their stored
  rate. New finalizations get the corrected rate. Per
  `feedback_no_speculative_backfill`.
- **Multi-jurisdiction still shows a blended header %** — acceptable; the
  per-jurisdiction breakdown (already rendered when >1 jurisdiction) carries the
  real per-rate detail.

## Revisit trigger

**The first design partner who registers in a multi-component tax jurisdiction
and needs a compliant itemized invoice.** Concretely: **Canada** —
Quebec/BC/Manitoba/Saskatchewan, where federal **GST** and provincial
**QST/PST** are levied and administered separately — or **domestic India**
(intra-state **CGST + SGST**). For one customer in one geographic jurisdiction,
Stripe returns a **multi-entry** `tax_breakdown` array (e.g. Quebec: GST 5% +
QST 9.975%). Today the engine collapses that to the **blended effective rate**
(~14.975%): the amount is correct (Stripe sums the components into the per-line
`amount_tax`, copied verbatim) but the components are not itemized. US sales tax
(combined into one entry) and India OIDAR/digital (IGST, single 18%) stay
single-entry and are unaffected — this is **not** triggered by them.

The fix is **additive — a new per-line tax-components collection, not a rewrite
of the scalar model**:

1. **Storage.** Add a child `invoice_line_tax_components` table (or a JSONB
   column on the line) holding `[{tax_name, jurisdiction, rate, amount_cents}]`
   per line — mirroring Stripe's `tax_breakdown` (Stripe supports up to 10 tax
   rates per line item). Additive migration; the existing scalar
   `invoice_line_items.{tax_rate, tax_jurisdiction, tax_amount_cents}` stay as
   the blended summary, so nothing downstream breaks.
2. **`invoices.tax_rate` is unchanged.** It remains the summary scalar;
   `displayTaxRate` already returns the blended effective rate for the
   multi-component case, which is the correct header value. No semantic break to
   this ADR's decision — components are *additional* detail, not a replacement.
3. **Mapping.** In `mapResult`, map the **full** per-line `tax_breakdown` array
   into the new collection instead of reading only `tax_breakdown[0]` — this is
   the latent `[0]`-only read called out in the **Risks** above; it MUST be
   fixed in the same change or the new path silently drops the second component
   (QST/SGST). Revisit the deliberate decision **not** to expand
   `line_items.data.tax_breakdown` (we rely on the document-level breakdown
   today, see `stripe.go`); either flip the expand and harden against its
   per-calc error mode, or derive components from the document-level array.
4. **Rounding.** Each component rounds to the cent; the components must still
   reconcile to the line's `tax_amount_cents` (and the invoice total) — apply
   the largest-remainder apportionment from ADR-046 *per component* so the sum
   invariant holds.
5. **Display.** Render itemized component lines ("GST (5%)", "QST (9.975%)")
   instead of the single combined tax line, on the invoice PDF, credit-note PDF,
   hosted invoice page, and operator detail. `aggregateTaxByJurisdiction`
   (`internal/invoice/pdf.go`) generalizes to aggregate by component; the
   hosted page (which today shows no per-rate breakdown) gains one.

What does **not** change: the tax amount (already correct), the provider
abstraction, and this ADR's statutory-vs-effective rule for the scalar field.
The manual provider stays single-rate (it applies one flat tenant rate) unless a
separate decision adds multi-rate manual support.
