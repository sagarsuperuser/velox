# Operations Runbook

What pages oncall, what doesn't, and what to do when Velox is in
trouble. Velox-specific failure modes only — generic Postgres / K8s /
Stripe troubleshooting is out of scope.

## Health endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness — process running | Kubernetes liveness probe |
| `GET /health/ready` | Readiness — DB reachable (ping), scheduler ran recently | Kubernetes readiness probe + LB health check |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus scrape (Bearer `METRICS_TOKEN` when set) | Metrics-collection job |

`/health/ready` returns 503 if the scheduler hasn't ticked in
2× the configured interval — this catches scheduler stalls without
requiring liveness restart. See "Scheduler stalled" below.

## Key metrics to alert on

All metrics are exported under `/metrics`. The set below is the
alerting tier — what should page someone vs. what's informational.

### Page (critical)

| Metric | Threshold | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `velox_http_request_duration_seconds` p99 | > 5s for 5m | Server is unhealthy |
| `velox_billing_cycle_errors_total` | rate > 0.1/s for 5m | Billing cycles failing systematically |
| `up{job="velox"}` | == 0 | Process down |
| Postgres connection errors (count) | > 10/min | DB connectivity broken |
| `time() - velox_scheduler_last_run_timestamp_seconds` | > 2× tick interval | Scheduler stalled (also flips `/health/ready` to 503) |

### Warn (slack/email, not page)

| Metric | Threshold | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `velox_payment_charges_total{outcome="failed"}` | rate spikes 5× baseline | Stripe issue or systematic decline |
| `velox_dunning_runs_processed_total{outcome="failed"}` | rate > 0.5/s | Dunning machinery struggling |
| `velox_webhook_deliveries_total{outcome="failed"}` | sustained failure | Customer's webhook endpoint down or signature wrong |
| `velox_stripe_breaker_state` | == 1 (open) | Stripe API circuit-breaker tripped |
| `velox_email_outbox_pending` | > 1000 | Email dispatcher stuck or SMTP provider issue (−1 = the metric query itself failed) |
| `velox_webhook_outbox_pending` | > 1000 | Webhook dispatcher stuck (−1 = metric query failed) |
| `velox_creditnote_pending_issue_drafts` | sustained growth over days | Clawback drafts not issuing. NOTE: drafts deferred behind an in-flight source payment (ADR-059) sit here legitimately and do NOT appear in error logs — the reconciler's eligibility scan skips them by design until the source settles. Alert on growth/age, not presence. |
| `velox_auto_charge_retries_total{outcome="failed"}` | growing rapidly | Many invoices stuck in retry |
| `velox_audit_write_errors_total` | rate > 0/s | Audit log writes failing — SOC 2 evidence at risk |
| `velox_audit_uncovered_mutation_total{route}` | any increase | A route mutated state and wrote NO audit row. Should be **flat zero**: every mutating route is declared in `internal/api/audit_routes.go` as `explicit` (it emits) or `exempt` (it doesn't need to). A non-zero counter means one of three things, in order of likelihood: (1) a route declared `explicit` has an emission path that can be skipped — find it via the `route` label and the `UNCOVERED MUTATION` error log; (2) a genuinely non-mutating 2xx path (a cache/idempotency replay, a no-op save) needs an `audit.MarkSkip` declaration; (3) a new route shipped without a declaration — impossible via CI (the route-walk test fails the build), but possible if the registry was edited to silence it. Do not "fix" this by adding an exemption without recording what is being given up. |

## Failure modes — diagnosis + fix

### 1. Scheduler stalled

**Symptom**: `/health/ready` returns 503; subscriptions due for billing
aren't being invoiced; `velox_billing_cycles_total` rate drops to 0.

**Why it happens**:
- Long-running transaction holding row locks (e.g., a tenant with
  millions of usage events on a single sub).
- DB primary failover; connections lost mid-tick.
- Scheduler goroutine panic'd (rare; `slog.Error` logs it).

**Diagnose**:
```sql
-- Long-running queries
SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS duration, state, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active' AND query_start < now() - interval '30 seconds'
ORDER BY duration DESC;

-- Scheduler last-run timestamp (from /health/ready response body)
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health/ready
```

**Fix**:
1. Check application logs for panics; restart pod if found.
2. Cancel long queries with `SELECT pg_cancel_backend(<pid>)` if
   appropriate.
3. Batch size is a fixed literal (50 subs per tick, `cmd/velox/main.go`)
   and is not env-configurable today; a hot-spotting tenant is drained
   on demand with `POST /v1/billing/run` (per tenant, loops until empty)
   rather than by shrinking the batch.

### 2. Email outbox backed up

**Symptom**: `email_outbox` table growing past 1000 rows in
`status='pending'`; customers report missing invoice emails.

**Why**:
- SMTP provider rate-limiting or down.
- Provider rejected mail (auth, sender domain, etc).
- Dispatcher stopped (rare).

**Diagnose**:
```sql
SELECT email_type, status, count(*), max(attempts) AS max_attempts
FROM email_outbox
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'failed')
GROUP BY email_type, status
ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

-- Most-recent failure messages (truncated to most-recent N)
SELECT email_type, last_error, count(*)
FROM email_outbox
WHERE status = 'failed' AND last_error IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY email_type, last_error
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Fix**:
1. Diagnose SMTP provider via `last_error`.
2. Once provider is healthy, the dispatcher drains automatically;
   pending rows fire on their `next_attempt_at` schedule.
3. To speed recovery, mass-reset `next_attempt_at` to now:
   ```sql
   UPDATE email_outbox SET next_attempt_at = now()
   WHERE status = 'pending' AND attempts < 15;
   ```
4. Failed (DLQ'd) rows: investigate root cause, then either fix-and-
   retry (`UPDATE ... SET status='pending', attempts=0`) or accept
   loss + alert affected customers.

### 3. Webhook outbox backed up

**Symptom**: Same as email outbox but for `webhook_outbox`.

**Why**:
- Customer's webhook endpoint is down or rejecting.
- HMAC signature mismatch (customer rotated secret without telling
  Velox).

**Diagnose**:
```sql
SELECT we.event_type, wo.status, count(*), max(wo.attempts) AS max_attempts
FROM webhook_outbox wo
JOIN webhook_endpoints we ON we.id = wo.endpoint_id
WHERE wo.status IN ('pending', 'failed')
GROUP BY we.event_type, wo.status;

-- Per-endpoint failure rate
SELECT endpoint_id, last_error, count(*)
FROM webhook_outbox
WHERE status = 'failed' AND last_error IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY endpoint_id, last_error
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Fix**:
1. Contact customer; confirm endpoint is up.
2. If signature mismatch: rotate signing secret in dashboard
   (`Webhooks → Endpoint → Rotate secret`), customer updates their
   side, replay failed events.

### 4. Dunning circuit breaker open

**Symptom**: `velox_stripe_breaker_state == 1`; dunning retries
silently skipping (correct behaviour); customers report they
expected retries but no email arrived.

**Why**:
- Stripe API has been failing repeatedly; breaker tripped to protect
  the retry budget.
- Tenant's Stripe credentials are invalid (per-tenant breaker).

**Diagnose**:
```sql
-- Check recent payment retry outcomes
SELECT outcome, count(*) FROM (
  SELECT
    CASE WHEN reason LIKE '%breaker%' OR reason LIKE '%transient%'
         THEN 'transient_skip'
         ELSE 'real_failure' END AS outcome
  FROM invoice_dunning_events
  WHERE event_type = 'retry_attempted' AND created_at > now() - interval '1 hour'
) t GROUP BY outcome;
```

**Fix**:
1. Check Stripe status (`status.stripe.com`).
2. If tenant-specific: verify Stripe credentials in
   `Settings → Stripe`; rotate if needed.
3. Breaker auto-resets after cool-off; no manual intervention
   normally required.

### 5. Stale `payment_status='unknown'` invoices

**Symptom**: Invoices stuck at `payment_unconfirmed` for hours.

**Why**:
- Stripe webhook delivery delayed or lost.
- Reconciler isn't running (single-instance assumption broken?).
- The PI is parked at `requires_action` (off-session SCA nobody
  completes). The reconciler resolves only TERMINAL Stripe outcomes —
  it deliberately skips in-flight PIs every sweep, so these never
  self-heal: cancel the PI in Stripe (the reconciler then settles it
  failed) or get the customer to complete authentication.

**Diagnose**:
```sql
SELECT id, payment_status, stripe_payment_intent_id, updated_at
FROM invoices
WHERE payment_status = 'unknown' AND updated_at < now() - interval '1 hour'
LIMIT 20;
```

**Fix**:
1. Check application logs for "reconciler" entries; reconcilers run
   once per scheduler tick (1h in production, 5m in local), not on a
   60s loop.
2. There is no manual bulk-reconcile endpoint. The payment reconciler
   sweeps automatically every tick; per invoice, use the dashboard's
   invoice attention actions (charge now / retry) — the reconciler's
   next pass also self-heals any invoice whose PI reached a terminal
   state at Stripe.

### 6. Test-clock advance hung

**Symptom**: `test_clocks.status='advancing'` for >5min; operator
sees Advancing badge stuck.

**Why**:
- Catchup loop processing many cycles — large jump on a monthly sub
  can require dozens of billing-engine sweeps.
- Billing-engine error mid-catchup; sub flipped to
  `internal_failure`.

**Diagnose**:
```sql
SELECT id, name, status, frozen_time, updated_at
FROM test_clocks WHERE status = 'advancing';

-- Check catchup progress: subscriptions on this clock
SELECT s.id, s.next_billing_at, count(i.id) AS invoices_generated
FROM subscriptions s
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON i.subscription_id = s.id AND i.created_at > tc.updated_at
JOIN test_clocks tc ON tc.id = s.test_clock_id
WHERE tc.id = '<clock_id>'
GROUP BY s.id, s.next_billing_at, tc.updated_at;
```

**Fix**:
1. If progress is happening (invoices being generated), wait — large
   jumps take time.
2. If `internal_failure`, the operator needs to delete the clock and
   start over (per ADR-011 Test Clocks design).

### 7. RLS leakage suspected

**Symptom**: A tenant reports seeing another tenant's data, OR a
support ticket includes data from a different tenant than the
operator's session.

**This is a SEV-1.** RLS leakage is the worst-case bug.

**Diagnose**:
1. Lock down. Velox has NO read-only mode — contain by revoking API
   keys (dashboard → API Keys) and/or stopping the API container;
   Postgres stays up for forensics.
2. Verify RLS is enabled on every tenant-scoped table:
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
   FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = false
   ORDER BY tablename;
   ```
   Anything unexpected here = isolation broken.
3. Check the leaked query: was it run with `app.tenant_id` correctly
   set? `app.bypass_rls`?

**Fix**:
- Patch the path that bypassed RLS.
- Audit `audit_log` for affected tenant pair.
- Notify both customers + breach review.

## Scheduler interval tuning

The tick interval and batch size are compiled-in, not env-configurable:
the scheduler ticks every **1 hour** in staging/production and **5
minutes** only when `APP_ENV=local`, and processes a fixed **50 subs per
tick** (`cmd/velox/main.go`). A tenant with a backlog is drained on
demand via `POST /v1/billing/run` (loops until that tenant is empty)
rather than by tuning these knobs.

Watch `velox_billing_cycle_duration_seconds` to ensure each tick fits
inside the interval; if a tick runs long, the leader-held advisory lock
makes the next tick skip rather than collide, so you'll see skipped
ticks (not lock waits) and a lengthening backlog.

## Manual operator interventions

Documented operator-side actions for incidents:

### Force-resolve a stuck dunning run

```sql
UPDATE invoice_dunning_runs
SET state = 'resolved', resolution = 'manually_resolved',
    resolved_at = now(), next_action_at = NULL
WHERE id = '<run_id>';

INSERT INTO invoice_dunning_events (run_id, invoice_id, event_type, state, reason)
VALUES ('<run_id>', '<invoice_id>', 'resolved', 'resolved', 'manually_resolved');
```

Use only when dashboard "Resolve" action is unavailable. Audit log
this action.

### Force-mark an invoice paid (offline payment received)

Use the dashboard's `Mark as paid` action. Direct SQL alternative:

```sql
-- payment_status has a CHECK (pending/processing/succeeded/failed/unknown) —
-- 'paid' is an INVOICE status, not a payment_status. Mirror what MarkPaid does:
UPDATE invoices
SET status = 'paid', payment_status = 'succeeded',
    amount_paid_cents = amount_due_cents, amount_due_cents = 0,
    paid_at = now(), auto_charge_pending = false, updated_at = now()
WHERE id = '<invoice_id>';
```

Audit log this action manually if running SQL directly.

### A customer has no usable payment method on file

There is no `setup_status` flag to flip — the `customer_payment_setups`
table was dropped (migration 0097); saved cards live in the
`payment_methods` table, written by the Stripe `setup_intent.succeeded` /
`payment_method.attached` webhooks. If a webhook was missed, the fix is
to re-drive it (re-send from the Stripe dashboard) or have the customer
re-add a card via the hosted payment-setup page — not a SQL flag flip.

## Logs to grep when paged

Velox uses structured logging via `slog`. Useful greps:

```bash
# Billing cycle errors
grep "billing cycle complete" log | jq 'select(.errors > 0)'

# Auto-charge failures
grep "auto-charge failed" log

# Webhook delivery failures
grep "webhook delivery failed" log

# Tax provider failures
grep "tax outcome" log | jq 'select(.outcome == "failed")'

# Scheduler last run
grep "billing cycle started" log | tail -5
```

Trace IDs (`Velox-Request-Id` header) propagate across logs and
appear in error responses — paste a request ID into your log
aggregator to see the full request chain.

## Escalation

For SEV-1 (data leakage, billing-correctness bug, all customer
charges failing):

1. Stop the bleeding: revoke API keys / stop the API container (no
   read-only mode exists); pause webhook delivery by deactivating
   endpoints (PATCH active=false — keeps the signing secret).
2. Snapshot DB state for forensic review.
3. Assemble responders: backend lead + DBA + (if customer-facing)
   support lead.
4. Communicate: status page, affected customer notifications.
5. Postmortem within 5 business days.

For SEV-2 (subset of customers affected; financial impact bounded):

1. Identify affected scope via DB query.
2. Page on-call engineer (don't wait for next business day on
   billing issues).
3. Patch + retroactive correction (credit notes, manual reconcile).
4. Postmortem.

For SEV-3 (small operator UX issue, edge case):

- File an issue, schedule for next sprint.
