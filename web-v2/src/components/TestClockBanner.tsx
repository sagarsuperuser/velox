// TestClockBanner sits at the top of any detail page whose entity is
// pinned (directly or via its subscription) to a test clock. Test
// clocks let operators advance simulated time independently of
// wall-clock; rows finalized / billed / dunned during a clock-advance
// carry the simulated timestamp, which can render as a future date in
// the activity timeline (e.g. "Invoice finalized · Jun 1, 2026" while
// the operator is reading the page on May 2). The banner sets the
// expectation upfront so the operator stops wondering "why is this in
// the future."
//
// Crucially, the banner shows the test clock's CURRENT frozen_time so
// the operator has a reference point. Without this, an invoice with
// "Due Jul 17, 2026" rendered alongside a "Past due" pill looks
// contradictory — until you know the simulation has been advanced to
// Sep 2, 2026 and Jul 17 is genuinely past in simulation time.
// Industry pattern (Stripe Test Clocks UI): the simulation timestamp
// is always visible on every page that consults it.
//
// React Query dedupes the test-clock fetch across components — the
// parent page often already loads the same clock for other UI
// purposes, so this hook adds no network round-trip.
