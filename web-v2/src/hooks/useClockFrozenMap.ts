// useClockFrozenMap returns a `test_clock_id -> frozen_time` lookup so any
// relative-time / cycle-progress surface can compute its "now" baseline from
// the SIMULATED time of a clock-pinned entity instead of wall-clock Date.now().
//
// Test clocks let operators advance simulated time independently of the wall
// clock; an entity's domain timestamps (billing-period bounds, finalized_at,
// due/expiry dates) are then stamped in simulation time and can sit far in the
// browser's future/past. Any UI that renders a value RELATIVE to "now" — "X
// ago", "in N days", cycle progress %, "Day N of M" — has to read that "now"
// from the clock, or it lies. See ExpiryBadge / DueBadge / InvoiceAttention /
// pages/Dunning for the established effective-now pattern.
//
// Previously this map was hand-rolled inline (Subscriptions.tsx); the omission
// of that copy in CostDashboard is exactly what left its cycle progress reading
// wall-clock time on clock-pinned subs. Centralizing it here removes the
// per-call-site drift that caused the miss.

// mount, exactly as the prior in-memo fallback did). Use in detail pages and
// per-customer cards; use useEffectiveNowResolver for lists of mixed pins.
