# Velox self-host on a single VM (Docker Compose)

A 5-minute path from a fresh VM to a working Velox tenant. Five
containers behind one nginx: postgres, redis, velox-api, velox-dashboard, nginx.
Migrations run on first boot.

## Prerequisites

- Docker 24+ with the Compose plugin (`docker compose version` works)
- Open inbound TCP/80 if you want the API reachable from outside the VM
- ~1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM is enough for evaluation; production sizing in
  [`docs/self-host.md`](../../docs/self-host.md)

## 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagarsuperuser/velox.git
cd velox/deploy/compose
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the four required secrets:

```bash
# Postgres admin/migration password
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)

# Password for the least-privilege velox_app runtime role (RLS enforced).
# hex output keeps it URL-safe — it's embedded into a connection URL.
VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)

# 64 hex chars (32 bytes) for PII encryption-at-rest
VELOX_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Authorises POST /v1/bootstrap to create the first tenant (min 16 chars)
VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

(Or generate them in-shell and paste in.) Everything else in `.env` is
optional — the binary boots without SMTP or Stripe configuration. See
`.env.example` for the full list.

## 2. Bring the stack up

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

First boot does three things you'll see in the logs:

1. `postgres` initialises the `velox` database and creates the
   `velox_app` runtime role with your `VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD` (see
   `postgres-init.sh`).
2. `velox-api` starts with `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_BOOT=true`, applies all
   pending migrations from `internal/platform/migrate/sql/`, verifies
   the runtime role cannot bypass RLS, then begins serving on `:8080`
   and starts the in-process scheduler.
3. `nginx` proxies host `:80` to `velox-api:8080`.

Tail the logs while it converges:

```bash
docker compose logs -f velox-api
```

You're done when you see `"listening" addr=:8080`.

## 3. Health check

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost/health
# {"status":"ok"}

curl -fsS http://localhost/health/ready
# {"checks":{"api":"ok","database":"ok","scheduler":"..."},"status":"ok"}
```

`/health` is liveness (process up). `/health/ready` is readiness
(database reachable + scheduler not stalled). Wire your load balancer's
health check to `/health/ready`.

## 4. Create your first tenant

The bootstrap endpoint is gated by the token you set in `.env`.

**Run this ON the VM** (`http://localhost/...`) or through an SSH
tunnel — the response carries your owner password and live API key, and
this stack terminates no TLS; do not send it over plain HTTP across a
network. The token travels in the `Authorization` header (never a query
string) so it stays out of proxy access logs.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/v1/bootstrap \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VELOX_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tenant_name":"Acme","owner_email":"you@example.com","owner_password":"a-strong-password-12ch"}'
```

(`owner_email`/`owner_password` are optional — omitted, the owner is
`admin@velox.local` with a generated password returned once. Passwords
must be at least 12 characters.)

The response carries, exactly once (Velox stores only hashes — none of
it is recoverable later):

- your dashboard owner credentials (`owner_email` / `owner_password`)
  — log in at `http://localhost/` (the `velox-dashboard` container serves
  the operator UI behind the same proxy as the API),
- a TEST secret key (`vlx_secret_test_…`),
- a LIVE secret key (`vlx_secret_live_…` — charges real cards; ignore
  it until you mean it),
- a test publishable key.

A repeat call answers `409 already_bootstrapped` — one-shot by design.

## 5. Verify

```bash
SECRET=vlx_secret_test_...
curl -fsS http://localhost/v1/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SECRET}"
# {"data":[],"has_more":false}
```

You're live.

## Operating the stack

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| View logs | `docker compose logs -f` |
| Restart the API | `docker compose restart velox-api` |
| Update to a new image tag | edit `VELOX_IMAGE` in `.env`, then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` |
| Stop everything (preserve data) | `docker compose stop` |
| Stop and wipe data | `docker compose down -v` |
| Run a one-off migration command | `docker compose run --rm velox-api migrate status` |
| Open a psql shell | `docker compose exec postgres psql -U velox -d velox` |

## TLS

This stack listens on plain HTTP. For production add TLS one of two
ways:

- **Managed load balancer in front** — AWS ALB, Cloudflare, GCP HTTPS LB.
  Terminate TLS there, target this VM's port 80 over private network.
- **certbot on the host** — install nginx on the host (not inside the
  compose stack), terminate TLS there, proxy to `localhost:80`. Or run
  certbot in a sidecar container and bind-mount certificates into the
  nginx container.

Either way, set `APP_ENV=production` (default) so secure-cookie and
HSTS protections are on.

## Backups

Once data matters, follow
[`docs/ops/backup-considerations.md`](../../docs/ops/backup-considerations.md)
for a `pg_basebackup` + WAL-archive recipe and a tested restore drill.

## Troubleshooting

**`velox-api` exits with `VELOX_ENCRYPTION_KEY is required in production`** —
set the key in `.env` (64 hex chars, generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`)
and `docker compose up -d` again. Production refuses to start without it
to avoid silently storing PII in plaintext.

**`velox-api` exits with `APP_DATABASE_URL is required in production`
or `default/guessable password`** — set `VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD` in
`.env` (compose builds `APP_DATABASE_URL` from it) and bring the stack
back up. Production refuses to run the request path on the admin role
or on the publicly documented default password.

**`velox-api` exits with `could not open the app database connection`** —
the `velox_app` role is missing or its password doesn't match
`VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD`. `postgres-init.sh` only runs on a FRESH
`pgdata` volume; on an existing volume create or rotate the role
manually (psql's `:'pw'` quoting keeps any password intact):

```bash
docker compose exec -e VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD postgres \
  psql -U velox -d velox -v pw="$VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD" \
  -c "ALTER ROLE velox_app PASSWORD :'pw'"
# role doesn't exist yet? CREATE it instead:
#   -c "CREATE ROLE velox_app WITH LOGIN PASSWORD :'pw'" \
#   -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE velox TO velox_app" \
#   -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO velox_app" \
#   -c "ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO velox_app" \
#   -c "ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO velox_app"
```

**`velox-api` exits with `role can BYPASS row-level security`** —
`APP_DATABASE_URL` points at the admin/superuser role (usually a
copied `DATABASE_URL`). Point it at `velox_app`.

**`/health/ready` returns 503 with `scheduler: degraded`** — the
scheduler tick window has elapsed without a recorded run. Usually means
the API process is alive but the leader-locked work isn't progressing.
Check the API logs and the `pg_locks` table.

**Port 80 is already in use** — set `NGINX_HTTP_PORT=8080` (or any free
port) in `.env` and bring the stack back up.

## What's next

- [`docs/self-host.md`](../../docs/self-host.md) — top-level self-host landing
- [`docs/ops/backup-considerations.md`](../../docs/ops/backup-considerations.md) — backup + restore drill

Kubernetes (Helm) and Terraform install paths are deliberately not
shipped in v1 — they land when a design partner names the flavour they
actually run.
