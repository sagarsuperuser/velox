#!/bin/bash
# Velox single-VM Postgres init — runs INSIDE the postgres container on
# first boot of a fresh pgdata volume (docker-entrypoint-initdb.d).
#
# Velox connects via two roles:
#   $POSTGRES_USER — owner / migration role (superuser in this image)
#   velox_app      — least-privilege runtime role; RLS is enforced here.
#
# Why a separate app role: superusers and BYPASSRLS roles defeat
# row-level security wholesale (every RLS table is FORCE ROW LEVEL
# SECURITY, so plain ownership does not). The API refuses to boot in
# production when APP_DATABASE_URL is missing, carries a default
# password, or points at a bypass-capable role (ADR-073).
#
# The password comes from VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD (compose passes it to
# this container). psql's :'var' quoting is used so any legal password
# survives — do NOT inline it into the SQL string.
#
# Existing pgdata volumes: this script does NOT re-run. Rotate the role
# password manually instead:
#   docker compose exec postgres psql -U velox -d velox \
#     -v pw="$VELOX_APP_DB_PASSWORD" \
#     -c "ALTER ROLE velox_app PASSWORD :'pw'"
