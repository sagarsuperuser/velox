# Build stage
# Pin the exact patch (not the floating 1.25 tag) so the shipped binary always
# carries the patched stdlib — the build cache otherwise reuses an older 1.25.x
# layer and the image ships CVEs the Grype gate (critical) then rejects.
#
# This pin MUST be >= go.mod's `go` directive. The image runs GOTOOLCHAIN=local,
# so an older builder does not silently download a newer toolchain — it refuses:
# "go.mod requires go >= 1.25.12 (running go 1.25.11)". CI enforces the ordering
# (the go-version-consistency step in .github/workflows/ci.yml), because the
# docker job only runs on main: bumping go.mod in a PR used to leave main's
# image build broken with nothing failing until after the merge.
